                The UIC Interactive Campus Map was launched in August 2014 and displays a wide array of information resources for UICâs students, visitors, faculty and staff.  It provides university building and parking information, assists with directions, outlines UIC shuttle routes and provides high-resolution, print-optimized campus maps in PDF format available for download.
                <br>
                <br>
                The map was developed by the Office of Capital Planning and Project Management and UIC graduate students in collaboration with Academic Computing and Communications Center, Office of Public and Government Affairs and other campus units using Google Maps Application Programming Interface (API) with a custom designed map overlay. Feedback may be provided using the âFeedbackâ link found on the bottom of the map.

In seeking to move beyond âthe boredom of the box,â Netsch created imaginative but organically integrated spaces. The double helix served as the inspiration for the Art and Design Studios building interior, translating to a helical path of open spaces where faculty and students could work side by side in a collaborative manner.|0641;41.876442;-87.649857;30;Art and Exhibition Hall;AEH;400 South Peoria Street,60607;641;The Art and Exhibition Hall is home to the Center for Urban Economic Development, Urban Planning and Public Affairs as well as to classes in the School of Art and Design.
