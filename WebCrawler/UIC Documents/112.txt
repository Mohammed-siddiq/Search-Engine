An “advising hold” will be placed on your account, which will not be removed until you have completed an advising meeting. In fall and spring, you will receive an email about signing up for an appointment. You should complete your appointment before registration becomes available in the 11th week of the semester.  If you do not hear from your advisor by the ninth week of the semester, we encourage you to reach out to your advisor immediately. You can find your advisor on the advising list .  When you come to your advising meeting, you must bring your DARS report, list of courses you are interested in taking for the next semester, and any questions you have. During or after the advising meeting, fill out the advising form with your advisor and submit it to the CS Student Affairs office in SEO 905. Keep your white copy for your records. Staff in the office will remove your advising hold within two to three business days. If you have questions, contact Student Affairs at 312-413-4950/ 312-996-2290 or ugrad@cs.uic.edu .           Tutoring   The computer science department offers peer-tutoring services that focus on 100, 200, and 300 level courses. A list of current tutors and the schedule is available via this link . Generally, tutoring is available no earlier than 10am and no later than 9pm from Monday through Friday in 2250 SELE. No appointment is necessary.           Transfer credits   All transfers and credits are handled through the College of Engineering, not directly through the computer science department. Please see an academic advisor in Room 123 of the SEO building or call 312-996-3463 .           Students with disabilities   UIC and the computer science department are committed to providing an educational environment that is accessible to all students. In accordance with this commitment, students in need of accommodations due to a disability are encouraged to contact the Disability Resource Center (phone: 312-413-2183) for determination of reasonable accommodations as soon as possible.              Arshad Narmawala        “I knew I liked building things and solving problems, so engineering seemed like a good fit for me. On campus, I spend a lot of time in the CS Lounge. There are so many like-minded people in the same space helping one another out. It’s inspiring and motivating. Off campus, my favorite place in Chicago is Indian Boundary Park Pond. It’s a medium-sized pond that has turtles in it, and it’s a great spot to relax and forget about all your worries.”    Arshad Narmawala | BS in Computer Science             Undergraduate              Admitted Students    Admissions    CS Major    CS Minor    Courses    Internships and Jobs    Scholarships    Student Organizations    Student Profiles    Student Resources                           College of  Engineering         Contact   Phone: (312) 996-3422  info@cs.uic.edu    Webmaster  coecomm@uic.edu      Social Media Accounts                        UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC Today  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        Powered by Red 2.4.3  © 2019 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield      Cookie Settings
