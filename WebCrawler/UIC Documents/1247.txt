They are specifically designed around a 0.8mm nozzle for printing large, strong parts very quickly.     The build volume is roughly 14″x14″x12″.  The Fusion3 currently is set up to print with PLA. We are shopping around for vendors and may switch materials. Currently we are limited to parts that are less than 0.5 kg of plastic.    While the parts print quickly there is a decrease in printing quality. This machine may not be suitable for all applications – our staff will help you determine if it is appropriate. Particularly supports don’t work as well at larger layer heights. Therefore care should be taken to eliminate overhangs so the part can print support free.    The printer uses Simplify3D for toolpath generation and we need STL files for printing.
