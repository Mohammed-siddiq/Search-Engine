Honors students enjoy such benefits as: small class sizes, leadership opportunities, Honors housing, undergraduate research, scholarships and a Faculty Fellow. You may apply to the Honors College when you are submitting your application to UIC.  UIC - North Park University Dual Degree Program  You will be immersed in the world of engineering from your first semester, spending time at both North Park University (NPU) and the College of Engineering (COE) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Most of years one, two, and four will be spent at NPU, completing Core Curriculum and physics courses. Years three and five, as well as two to three summers of classes and research, are spent primarily at UIC. During year three, you’ll choose either a civil or mechanical engineering track.  Throughout the dual-degree program , you’ll meet with a faculty advisor at NPU who will help guide you through the program, ensuring you complete necessary coursework on time and with success.  Based on the agreed articulation agreement, courses taken from NPU during this dual degree program will be accepted as trasnfer credit towards the UIC Engineering degree and courses taken at UIC will be used as transfer credit at NPU in order to facilitate the receipt of both degrees.  Guaranteed Admissions Transfer  A partnership between City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) and the University of Illinois at Chicago to support Chicago’s students. The GAT program offers guaranteed admission into the College of Engineering after taking courses in consultation with CCC and UIC school officials and maintain a 3.00 GPA.  Transfer Admission Guarantee  The TAG program is a partnership between specific Illinois Community Colleges and the University of Illinois at Chicago that offers a guaranteed transfer pathway to the College of Engineering. TAG offers certainty to parents and students who want to transfer to UIC rather than attend as first year students.
