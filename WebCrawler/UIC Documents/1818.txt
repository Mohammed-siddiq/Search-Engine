    Theoretical Computer Science at UIC       UIC's
department of Computer Science and the mathematical
    computer science group in the department of Mathematics (MSCS) are home to a lively theory presence.
Our unique structure helps facilitate regular collaborations between the theory
faculty and a diverse number of both computer scientists and mathematicians.
