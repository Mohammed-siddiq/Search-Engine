Frequently Asked Questions  What about privacy?  Any personal information you use to setup your UIC Rave Guardian Profile is stored privately and securely within Rave Mobile Safety's redundant and geographically diverse databases. Your profile can only be viewed by whomever you designate as a Guardian when your timer expires, or to UIC Police when you send a tip or contact UIC Police via the smartphone app.  Can Rave Guardian track me?  No, your privacy is of utmost importance. You can only be located if you have asked for help and UIC Rave Guardian is only enabled when you choose to activate an alarm on your phone.  UIC Rave Guardian and Smart911 can allow your designated Guardian to locate your approximate location when your timer expires. Additionally, Rave Guardian can allow UIC Police to locate your approximate location when you place a UIC Police call. However, it cannot be used to locate you without your knowledge. Your profile and location (if you have enabled the location service) are only available to your Guardian or UIC Police when your timer expires or you call UIC Police from within the smartphone app.  Do I have to have push notifications turned on for Rave Guardian?  We recommend that you allow notifications from UIC Rave Guardian. This will alert you when your timer is about to run out, when you've received a response from UIC Police, or when someone has requested you as a Guardian.  What should I include in my profile?  The more information you provide, the more UIC Police knows if they need to assist you in an emergency. At a minimum, your address (home and school), your physical description and a recent photo are great places to start. If you have a particular health issue or other personal safety concern, you can include that information as well. YOU decide what YOU provide.
