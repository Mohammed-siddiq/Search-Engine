Outdoor photography is permitted.  In addition, in the hospital, outpatient clinics, and all patient-care areas of the UI Hospital, HIPAA regulations require that a patient authorize release of any information pertaining to his/her stay, except in those cases of required disclosures. Public Affairs must ensure that all patients photographed, interviewed, or otherwise identified have signed the required consent forms.
