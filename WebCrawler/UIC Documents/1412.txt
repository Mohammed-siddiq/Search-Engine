A resume is a summary of your education, work history, and other accomplishments and skills. Resumes are the most common document requested of applicants in job applications.  A CV or curriculum vitae is a summary of your education, work history, and other accomplishment and skills and typically used when applying for international, academic, education, scientific, medical, or research positions or when applying for fellowships or grants.  CVs include more information than resumes with an emphasis on one’s academic background (e.g., teaching experience, degrees, research, awards, publications, presentations).  A cover letter is a letter of introduction attached to, or accompanying another document such as a resume or CV (Source:  Wikipedia).  Learn more about developing these materials in the sections below.
