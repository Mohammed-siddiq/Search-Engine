After graduation, I hope to be working at a fintech firm. My dream job is to be a self-employed iOS app developer. As a student, I had an Android app internship with DASLabs. I learned the way a lab works, and the flow of building a product from the ground up. My advice to other students is to start working earlier than you think.”    Sean Barber | BS in Computer Science             Undergraduate              Admitted Students    Admissions    CS Major    CS Minor    Courses    Internships and Jobs    Scholarships    Student Organizations    Student Profiles    Student Resources                           College of  Engineering         Contact   Phone: (312) 996-3422  info@cs.uic.edu    Webmaster  coecomm@uic.edu      Social Media Accounts                        UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC Today  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        Powered by Red 2.4.3  © 2019 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield      Cookie Settings
