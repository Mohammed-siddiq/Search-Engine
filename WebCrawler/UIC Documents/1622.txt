INDIGO collects, disseminates, and provides persistent and reliable access to the research and scholarship of faculty, staff, and students at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Faculty, staff, and graduate students can deposit their research and scholarship - unpublished and, in many cases, published - directly into INDIGO. Departments can use INDIGO to distribute their working papers, technical reports, or other research material. Contact us for more information (indigo@uic.edu).  The University Library supports publishing and scholarly communication through this repository and through our journal publishing platform Journals@UIC. These are part of the library's efforts to support eScholarship@UIC.  All theses and dissertations deposited from Fall 2011 onward are available in INDIGO.
