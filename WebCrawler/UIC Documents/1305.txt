Affected services:   The website: acm.cs.uic.edu.  ACM Email may be delayed.   At this time, acm.cs.uic.edu and related services should be back up.

If you have any questions, please let an ACM/LUG SysAdmin know by emailing sig-sysadmin [at] acm.cs.uic.edu or by messaging the #sig-sysadmin channel on Slack.
