However; the next group of seniors’ lives will be a little bit easier thanks to the hard work of student Milos Markovic. During his junior year, Markovic approached Clinical Assistant Professor Alan Zdunek about completing a research project this year. Zdunek had a project for Markovic that was eight plus years in the making. As part of the ChE 392 undergraduate research course, more commonly known as the unit operations lab, the students complete a liquid extraction experiment where they…  More...           UIC chemical engineering student Vrushant Patel wins Henry McCormack Outstanding Senior Award  April 17, 2019  The University of Illinois at Chicago’s Chemical Engineering Department selected Vrushant Patel to receive the 2019 Henry McCormack Outstanding Senior Award. The award is given out each year by the Chicago chapter of The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). Patel is one of the top students in the department and has the highest GPA in his senior class. He has completed research in Professor Vivek Sharma's Soft Matter Optics, Dynamics, Elasticity, and Self-Assembly (ODES) Lab. Clinical Assistant Professor Alan Zdunek said Patel has worked on visualization and characterization of beads-on-a-string formation on coated fibers using high speed imaging and measured extensional rheology response of polymer solutions using dripping-onto-substrate (DoS). He is a current member of AIChE and has received…  More...           Senior chemical engineering students work to turn leftover wood into new biofuel  April 1, 2019  When most people see a pile of sawdust, their instinct is to grab a broom to sweep up the mess, but a group of senior chemical engineering students is hoping to turn those brown leftovers green. The team, including Emily Buhle, Joseph Richard Kostenski, Corey Lawrence, and Mathew Wagener, is working to make a biodiesel fuel blend using woodchips and sawdust put through a process called gasification, which turns organic or fossil fuel-based materials into carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. Their goal is to create a renewable fuel source that is profitable and avoids an ethical issue that is attached to currently used biofuels derived from food crops such as corn or soybeans. They have been running scenarios on…  More...
