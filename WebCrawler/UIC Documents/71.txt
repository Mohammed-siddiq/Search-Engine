Classes will continue as scheduled for the remainder of the semester.  Both sides have been focused on the needs of our faculty and students and the mission of the university. With these new agreements, we will continue to move forward together and serve our city and state as Chicago’s public research university.  We thank the members of the University and the faculty bargaining teams for their dedication and commitment to UIC and their professionalism during the negotiation process.  The tentative agreements are subject to ratification and approval by both sides.
