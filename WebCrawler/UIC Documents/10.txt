All of our graduate courses are geared for students with an undergraduate degree in computer science or an equivalent understanding. Our undergraduate core curriculum consists of: CS 141, 151, 251, 261, 361, and 342. Please look over the topics covered and address any deficiencies either by enrolling in the appropriate undergraduate classes or through self-study.
