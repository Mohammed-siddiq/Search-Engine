These groups are responsible for reviewing and approving all research conducted by UIC faculty, employees, and students that involve human subjects, animal subjects, rDNA or biohazardous materials.  before the research is initiated. This includes interviews, pre-existing data, and human tissues obtained for non-research purposes. Students who plan to do research on human subjects must complete the training requirements regarding human subject protections before initiation of their research.  All research that involves animal subjects must be approved by the Animal Care Committee (ACC) before the research is initiated. Students who plan to use animal subjects in research must also complete GC 470 - Essentials for Animal Research, a one credit hour course that reviews the factors involved with assuring individual compliance with the regulations governing animal research and the responsibilities the researcher assumes when using animals.  The Institutional Biohazard Committee (IBC) must approve all research that involves biohazardous materials (including infectious, toxins and/or select agents), and recombinant DNA), before the research is initiated.  Theses that are not in compliance with the policies of the Office for the Protection of Research Subjects (OPRS) will not be accepted for fulfillment of graduation requirements.  Work that is completed prior to IRB approval cannot be published, even as a thesis.  The relevant policies, guidance, and application forms can be found on the OVCR website at: http://research.uic.edu/compliance/irb  See also Advisors ; Examination and Defense Committees ; Human Subjects ; and Radiation Safety .
