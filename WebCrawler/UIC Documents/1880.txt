  Smoothing for Multivariate Scores (SMS)    version 2.0  August 13, 2012  Overview  SMS is an open source, extensible and scalable convex solver for a number of machine learning problems cast in the form of regularized risk
minimization problem [1].  It is particularly advantageous for optimizing 
multivariate performance measure [2].  The implementation is "extensible" because the (problem-specific)
loss function modules are encapsulated with a common interface for the main 
optimizer.  Thus it is very simple to incorporate solutions to new 
problems.   At present, SMS can solve the
following problems:    Binary Hinge Loss Precision/Recall Break-even Point (PRBEP) [2] Area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROCArea) [2]    SMS is implemented with optimized efficiency.  It features parallel 
optimization, which is fuelled by the PETSc and TAO packages.  We also provide data files in PETSc format, which can be parsed 
and loaded an order of magnitude faster than the conventional LibSVM format.  Download  SMS version
