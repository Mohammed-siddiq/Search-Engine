Student Leadership and Civic Engagement supports students in using their right to vote, and in actively contributing to their communities. Through resources and programs for voter registration, education, and participation, we support students in making their voices heard and being informed and active citizens.

It means promoting the quality of life in a community, through both political and non-political processes” (Civic Responsibility in Higher Education, Ehrlich, 2000, p.vi).  “ Civic learning and democratic engagement means promoting the education of students for engaged citizenship through democratic participation in their communities, respect and appreciation of diversity, applied learning, and social responsibility” (NASPA, https://www.naspa.org/focus-areas/civic-learning-and-democratic-engagement ).  Community engagement is “Collaboration between institutions of higher education and their larger communities (local, regional/state, national, global) for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources in a context of partnership and reciprocity” (Carnegie Classification for Community Engagement).
