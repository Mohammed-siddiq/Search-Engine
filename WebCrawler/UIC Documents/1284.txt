Search for:                The AIAA (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics) chapter at the University of Illinois at Chicago is a student run organization located in Region III. It is primarily dedicated to the study of aerospace and propulsion engineering.  The club was formed in 2011 because the University of Illinois at Chicago does not currently have an aerospace engineering major for undergraduate students.

We design and build remote controlled aircraft’s, high powered rockets, and quad-copters. We compete in the AIAA Design Build Fly competition, Battle of the Rockets, and the Midwestern Robotics Design Competition.  2017-2018 SPONSORS          Individual Donors: Mr. Robbin Eliason, UTC Pratt & Whitney             Pictures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       April  2019         Sun  Mon  Tue  Wed  Thu  Fri  Sat        1        2        3        4        5        6         7        8        9        10    Sibling Day  Sibling Day  Starts:  12:00 am  Ends:  April 10, 2019 - 11:59 pm     More details...    •      11        12        13         14        15        16        17        18        19        20         21        22        23        24        25        26        27         28        29        30                     Contact  Secretary.aiaauic@gmail.com The Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering (M/C 251) University of Illinois at Chicago 2039 Engineering Research Facility 842 W.
