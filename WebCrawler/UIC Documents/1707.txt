Ricardo Ramirez | B.A., Psychology, 2017       The UIC Honors College offers the advantages of a small college with the opportunities of a large research university. The Honors College fosters a community of academic excellence, connects students with premier faculty, and promotes civic engagement and leadership opportunities.  The UIC Honors College is an option for undergraduate students at UIC who seek additional academic challenge and engagement opportunities outside the classroom.  Members of the Honors College take honors courses or participate in out-of-classroom learning experiences each semester. Key benefits of the Honors College include:   Small Honors-level courses and seminars taught by premiere faculty  Faculty Fellows and Honors Advisors assigned to all students for mentoring and advising  Merit and need-based scholarships  Engagement in undergraduate research, service, and leadership  Ongoing special events and organizations to engage with a community of like-minded peers  Special “Honors-only” facilities, including a computer lab, study room, social lounge, and kitchen in Burnham Hall, and optional Honors College Housing       Apply Now!
