We are happy to explain... The UIC Health Professions Student Council (HPSC) is a liaison organization between the individual health professions students, student groups, and the university at large. We appoint students to university and campus-wide committees to represent the interest of the health professional student body. Additionally, we fund the individual health professional student councils and provide additional funding to students for travel and interdisciplinary projects.

You are invited to participate in an “immersion day” on Friday, April 10, 2015 , when students from across the health sciences and other UIC colleges will convene in the UIC Forum for a half-day of interactive learning as part of a blended course. Readings and preparatory work are assigned in Blackboard prior to that day. The April 10 workshop itself is a face-to-face experience; students are expected to participate in person. Please note that if you are scheduled for your practicum during this time the practicum will take priority . Also, this is the date of the Illinois HIM Association Annual meeting in Springfield, Illinois if you are planning to attend that See attachment for more details on the IPE Immersion Day at UIC. Enrollment closes at 4:00 p.m. January 30, 2015 . Registration is on a first come, first-served basis and requires program approval. Students may choose to participate in this course as either a "resume-enhancing experience" (accrues no course credit) or by enrolling in a one-credit hour independent study, which may result in an additional charge for tuition. A written and submitted self-reflection summarizing the interprofessional education experience will be required for the credit-bearing independent study.
