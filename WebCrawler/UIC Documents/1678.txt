Official transcripts will be requested only from admitted students. Official transcripts received for records without a final decision may not be reflected in the application checklist until the end of the cycle.  Review the options below regarding online submission of acceptable transcripts for the purposes of application review:  Option 1 : You will need to request an official, sealed transcript from your prior college or university. It should be sent to your home, and must be opened, scanned and saved to your computer or other storage device as a PDF , then uploaded to the application checklist when requested.  Option 2 : If offered by your prior college or university, obtain an official PDF transcript through the school’s Registrar’s Office. This PDF can then be uploaded to the application checklist. PDFs in a Portfolio format and password-protected PDFs are not compatible with our system.  Some institutions may issue electronic transcripts with an expiration date . Please avoid uploading transcripts that are set to expire since credentials need to be viewed and reviewed throughout the application process (and available in the permanent record).  An additional transcript will be requested if previously uploaded transcripts are found to be expired and inaccessible. If you obtain a transcript that is set to expire, you may need to print and rescan it into PDF format in order to be able to provide a permanently available credential.    Transcripts should include all courses, credits, grades, and term information. Please also include the transcript key or legend, typically displayed on the back of the transcript.  Online academic histories or advising/degree audit documents that can be obtained through student web portals are not acceptable.    The University of Illinois at Chicago reserves the right to request official credentials at any time during the application process if deemed necessary, and rescind any offer of admission made if discrepancies between unofficial and official credentials are found.
