I invite you to make UIC your home." –Karen J. Colley, Dean of the Graduate College  The Admissions section of the Graduate College website is intended as a broad overview of applying to a graduate program at UIC. Applicants should consult the appropriate program/department pages of the online Graduate College Catalog for the specific admission requirements of each program/department .  Nondiscrimination Policy  Applicants are considered on an individual basis. Admission decisions are made in compliance with the University of Illinois nondiscrimination policy .  Policy on Conflicts of Interest in the Admissions Process  The Graduate College recognizes that the graduate admissions process does not, and should not, operate "blindly."  Programs and faculty frequently recruit students of whom they have direct knowledge.  Furthermore, the admission process for a doctoral program will frequently take into account the "fit" between a prospective graduate student's interests and those of the faculty in the program.  However, the admissions process should, and should be seen to, take into account only academic and programmatic consideration when admitting and recruiting students.
