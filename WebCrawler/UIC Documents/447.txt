Participants are lead through exercises to document and translate their own personal narratives into pictures and words. Using bookbinding tools such as beeswax, bone folders, awls, and needle and thread, participants learn simple techniques to bind their homemade stories.  Madeleine Aguilar creates humorous retellings of childhood memories from each house she has lived in, often returning to the methods and imagery developed from making comics to create a narrative in her work using fiber, drawing, and printmaking mediums. Madeline was born in Phoenix, AZ in 1998 and currently attends the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She is the author of many self-published comics and is a regular contributor to F Newsmagazine. She has performed at the Queens Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art.  This event is presented in conjunction with the exhibition Alberto Aguilar moves on human scale. It is free and open to all.
