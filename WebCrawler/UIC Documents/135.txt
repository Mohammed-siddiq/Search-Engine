Building a strong network of professional contacts now will help you throughout your career!         Networking Tips     What is networking?         What is networking?   Networking is simply a word to describe connecting with people in your chosen professional field. It’s a process of developing professional relationships that will help you grow your career.  You probably network regularly without realizing it (e.g. speaking with professors about your career goals, meeting a recruiter at a career fair and following up with a LinkedIn connection request, or asking a friend’s parent who’s also an engineer about how they got into engineering).        Why is networking important?         Why is networking important?   Believe it or not, as many as 80% of new jobs are never posted online ; they’re obtained through networking. That means that a majority of your job searching time should be spent networking.        Is it weird or inappropriate to approach strangers to ask for help?         Is it weird or inappropriate to approach strangers to ask for help?   Not at all! Most working professionals have obtained at least one job or internship through networking. Engineers and other professionals have been in your shoes before, and some will be happy to help you. Not everyone will be receptive or have time to give you advice, so, if one person can’t provide the information you want, move on to someone else.        Where and with whom can I network?         Where and with whom can I network?   Your network is a lot bigger than you think. Anybody you have ever met is part of your network, including but not limited to: family, friends, neighbors, co-workers, professors, and classmates. People who interview you are part of your network. Even some people you have never met are part of your network, including UIC alumni . The amount of networking opportunities available to you are only limited by your willingness and ability to talk to people.  You can network at real-time events (including career fairs, trade shows, networking-focused happy hour events, student org meetings, Career Center employer events) or virtually over email and LinkedIn. Check out events both on- and off-campus to talk to people who are working in your desired field(s).        How can I successfully network at a live event?         How can I be a successful networker?    Identify networking events to attend.  Find a friend to go with.  Set a realistic goal to make 3-5 connections at a networking event. Make sure to ask for a business card from each one so you can keep in touch.  Get to an event early to get comfortable with the environment.  Focus on asking questions to help ease into conversation. (e.g. How did you hear about this event? What does a typical day look like for you? What’s most rewarding/challenging about your job?)  DON’T ask them right away for a job or to refer you for an open position at their company! This comes across as pushy.  Practice talking to people at smaller networking events to boost your confidence to talk to people at larger events such as career fairs and trade shows.  Follow up with the people you meet by sending a personalized connection request on LinkedIn. But don’t bombard them with messages if they don’t reply! If they don’t reply to your message, let them be.         How can I network virtually?         How can I network virtually?   For networking virtually through email or LinkedIn:   Identify a person who works at a company that you want to work for or learn more about.  Send them a personalized note mentioning something you have in common (UIC alum, they had the same major as you in college, from the same geographic area, both interested in a specific field or industry, etc.).  Ask if they have a moment to speak with you about their company or field.  DON’T ask them right away for a job or to refer you for an open position at their company! This comes across as pushy.  If they agree to meet or speak with you on the phone, come prepared with questions and use their time wisely — don’t ask for more than 30 minutes of their time. You reached out to them, so they will expect you to lead the conversation.  Once you’ve spoken with them, congrats! This person is now in your network. Make sure to stay in touch with them periodically so you don’t lose touch!     Sample Message sent through a LinkedIn connection request:  Hi {NAME},  I’m an engineering student at UIC thinking about my overall career path. I’m interested in {INDUSTRY} and want to network with professionals in your field. I saw that you went to UIC for engineering as well! Would you be open to a conversation with me about what you do at {COMPANY NAME} and how you’ve gotten there?
