Bring Her Home is a project organized by All My Relations Gallery in partnership with the Minnesota Indian Women’s Resource Center and American Indian Community Housing Organization in Minnesota.       This lecture is presented by WLRC. Co-sponsored by UIC Gender and Women’s Studies, UIC Museum and Exhibition Studies, and UIC Native American Support Program.
