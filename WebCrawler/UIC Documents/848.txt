Mission  To be a source of competitive advantage and value for the University of Illinois by providing a wide range of information solutions and services to the University’s campuses, operating units, and external stakeholders.  ACCC and UIC  ACCC works closely with UIC's Provost and her office,  the campus IT Governance Committees appointed by the Provost, the faculty senate Academic Services Committee , and the Student Fee Advisory Committee. At the university level, we work with the University Technology Management Team , the Committee for Architecture and Vision , and several organizations on other campuses.  At the campus unit level, ACCC works with REACH , a group of departmental representatives each appointed by a department head.  REACH members often provide technical support to departments as part of their duties.  The connection between ACCC and REACH lets us coordinate services and information, and helps keep us informed about departmental needs.  We also coordinate with Phonebook Contacts (PB Contacts), who maintain information about people, affiliations and NetIDs in the UIC directories.  To find your REACH or PBContact representative, search for your department in the UIC Departments A-Z list.
