It is important to note that most UIC scholarships have deadlines during the springtime, and mostly require 12 hours completed at UIC with a GPA of 3.0 or above. Additionally, there are very few scholarship deadlines during June, July, and August. Students should not wait until just prior to the deadline when they, and many others, are likely to need assistance.  7. Where do I find scholarships?   Scholarships are offered through the university and from outside sources for incoming students, continuing students and graduating seniors. High school students applying to UIC only need to apply to the university and the designated special programs they are interested in (e.g. Honors College, GPPA, Business Scholars) to be considered for ALL scholarships available to incoming freshmen.  Continuing students can apply for UIC-based scholarships through UIC SnAP . Students can find external scholarships on the Scholarships section on this site, on our listserv , and in our library in Suite 1800 SSB (M-F, 9-5).  8. What is UIC SNAP?   The UIC Scholarship and Awards Program or UIC SnAP is UIC’s portal for continuing students to apply for scholarships.
