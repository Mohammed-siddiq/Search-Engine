Students who are considered for these scholarships are contacted directly by our WIEP Staff. These students must meet a certain academic criteria and attend a scholarship brunch event on campus for an interview. During this event, students also have an opportunity to meet other prospective students, current engineering students, staff and faculty members, and the Dean of Engineering, Dr. Peter Nelson.  We encourage all students to be active in their scholarship search and to consider external resources for additional opportunities.
