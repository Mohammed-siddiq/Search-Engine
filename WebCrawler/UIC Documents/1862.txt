Gmytrasiewicz  I am an associate professor at the Department of Computer Science, the University of Illinois at Chicago. I am a part of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at UIC, and I am leading the Multiagent Systems Group.   Contact  E-mail: piotr@uic.edu Mail: CS Depatrment, University of Illinois at Chicago, 851 S. Morgan Street, Chicago, IL 60607-7053 Voice: (312) 355-1320 Fax: (312) 413-0024  Teaching    CS 514: Applied Artificial Intelligence.  CS 594: Special Topics "Automated Optimal Decision-Making" .  CS 511: "Artificial Intelligence 2".    Research  My research centers around the notion of rationality in artificial intelligent agents. Rationality includes the ability to plan alternative courses of action, and the ability to determine, and robustly execute, the best of these alternatives. In my work I have been particularly interested in rational choice of action when other intelligent agents are present in the environment. Here, the main issues are how agents should decide what physical actions to execute to coordinate with anticipated actions of the other agents, and how they should decide what communicative actions to engage in. A related problem is that of a theoretical framework for representing knowledge and belief of agents interacting with other agents. My other work includes evolution of agent communication languages, frameworks for representing uncertain knowlegde about the environment evolving in time, the notions of time pressure and the value of time, and rational behavior and trade-offs under time pressure. I am also interested in decision-theoretic approaches to game theory, operations research, philosophies of agenthood, and in applications of rational autonomous agents in realistic distributed domains.
