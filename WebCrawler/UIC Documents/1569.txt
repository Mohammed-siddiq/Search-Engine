Jaimie Stewart, senior bioengineering major, plans to combine her passions for medicine, teaching, and minority participation in engineering  August 10, 2016  She’s had to work a lot harder than her nonminority counterparts to get where she’s headed, but that hasn’t stopped Jaimie Stewart from doing what she was made for. “I’ve pretty much loved science since I was in kindergarten,” she said. A recent bioengineering graduate, and current doctoral candidate at University of California Riverside, she is a first-generation college student and the first in her family to pursue engineering.This year the college projects that less than 2 percent of graduating engineers will be African American females. Many have identified this problem, and probably most would wait for someone else to fix it, but Jaimie wants to position herself to do something about it.

Inspired by comic book character Spider-Man, doctoral student Victor Mateevitsi developed and built, a system of wearable ultrasound sensors that can augment human sensory capacity  August 10, 2013  Victor Mateevitsi, PhD candidate in UIC's Department of Computer Science and a research assistant in UIC's Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), has created "SpiderSense," a prototype wearable suit that enables users to sense (without seeing) obstacles around them.Like the comic book character Spider-Man, whose skin tingles at approaching danger, SpiderSense augments human ability--it can potentially help a pedestrian "see" hidden dangers, assist a fireman entering smoke-filled buildings, or help a visually impaired person navigate his environment. SpiderSense consists of sensor modules strategically placed on the wearer's body. Using ultrasound to scan the environment for obstacles within 60 feet, it then translates the waves into tactile signals that stimulate the wearer's skin.SpiderSense (previously called NinjaVision) is an outgrowth of the UIC Human…  More...           Senior industrial engineering major, Nadya Fogarty, has taken a nontraditional path to her degree. Read about her journey.  August 10, 2013  Today, Nadya Fogarty is employed as an insurance marketing analyst for an internet company. A little while ago, she was a twenty-something in Bulgaria with no plans to come to the U.S. But Fogarty is the kind of person who tries surfing on a whim. “Any opportunity I have to see or do something new, I go for it,” she said. This unofficial rule has served as her internal compass, guiding her on her journey from making hotel beds to studying engineering.Despite her adventurous spirit, Fogarty knows that “going for it” can be lonely and intimidating. She first arrived nine years ago, at the urging of friends, to work at a North Carolina resort for the summer. “It was like…  More...           Junior mechanical engineering major Ante Kovacevic explores renewable energy initiatives in Costa Rica  August 10, 2013  If you see junior mechanical engineering major Ante Kovacevic, you should ask him how his Winter Break was, and you should prepare to be jealous. Tan, invigorated, and inspired, he’ll probably tell you he had the best experience of his life.Abandoning the chilly Chicago temperatures, Kovacevic spent twelve days in the Costa Rican tropics. Along with eighteen other undergraduates, he participated in The GREEN Program, which he discovered through UIC's Engineering Career Center. It was a dream come true for a renewable energy enthusiast with an adventurous spirit, like him. GREEN participants journey to Costa Rica to explore renewable energy initiatives through a combination of classroom sessions, hands-on field trips, and community service.Kovacevic visited hydro plants, wind farms, geothermal plants,…  More...
