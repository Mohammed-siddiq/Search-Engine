New Course Announcement IE 494: Haptics & Augmented Reality  July 9, 2010  Are you interested in learning a cool 3D-touch technology?The MIE Department introduces the UIC’s first hands-on course on haptics (or the sense of touch) and augmented reality. You’ll learn how to successfully combine high-level 3D graphics, haptics, collision detection and physics-based dynamic simulation for a more realistic interactive experience. You’ll be able to easily develop virtual reality applications to visualize and feel holographic-like virtual objects for engineering, medical, dental and scientific simulation and training.Multiple SensAble Technologies’ Omni haptic devices and PC workstations will be available for the students to develop the projects.Time: MW, 4:30 PM – 5:45 PMPlace: 3290 SELInstructor: Cristian LucianoPre-requisites: NoneRecommended for: Grads and undergradsFurther information: clucia1@uic.edu  More...

UIC in Princeton Review’s Top 50 Undergraduate Game Design Programs  February 28, 2010  February 28, 2010The February 28, 2010 issue of USA TODAY reported that the Princeton Review and GamePro magazine selected the best institutions in the USA and Canada where students can go to study game design. They chose 50 programs based on a 2009-2010 survey of administrators at institutions offering game design coursework and/or degrees. UIC is one of the distinguished institutions that made the overall Top 50 list -- and we can only presume it is because of the UIC Computer Science "Video Game Design and Development" class taught by EVL Director Jason Leigh.Selection criteria for the Undergraduate Game Design Program list included the quality of the curriculum, faculty credentials, facilities and infrastructure as well as data on scholarships, financial…  More...
