Bioengineers strive to understand biological systems, from molecules to whole organisms, from a quantitative and analytical perspective. In doing so, bioengineers enhance our ability to measure, image, repair or replace physiological substances or processes, and can uniquely address challenges at the interface of biology and medicine.  Training in this field prepares students for either graduate school, professional programs, or for positions in industry. Exciting career opportunities exist for bioengineers at the B.S. level in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and medical device industry as well as in hospitals, federal labs, and environmental agencies. In order to prepare students for careers in bioengineering, the department faculty does research in emerging areas of bioengineering (such as neural engineering, cell and tissue engineering, and bioinformatics), and maintains strong interactions with faculty in the Colleges of Medicine and Pharmacy, the Department of Biological Sciences, and other engineering disciplines.  The Bioengineering curriculum includes rigorous training in physiology and engineering fundamentals while building the trademark interdisciplinary repertoire of bioengineering with courses such as artificial organs and bio-optics. Each student must complete a program of required courses in one or more specialized areas (medical imaging, biosensors, rehabilitation engineering) best suited to the student's interest.  Bioengineering at the University of lllinois at Chicago distinguishes itself by offering a curriculum that reflects the contemporary convergence of intensive computation and molecular biology. From this pedagogical premise, the student will encounter educational opportunities that are quantitatively rigorous and yet recognize the significant contributions made by the empirical biological sciences.

At one end of the spectrum, computer science may be viewed as the formal study of what can be computed and what resources are required for computation. At the other end of the spectrum, computer science may be seen as the application of human resources, software and, of course, computers to solve computational problems relating to society's and individuals' needs.  A well-trained computer scientist requires a knowledge of both ends of this spectrum-and several points in between. The Computer Science program in the Department of Computer Science is intended to provide that broad background. Along with a strong theoretical component, the Computer Science program places special emphasis on the development of applied skills in design, implementation, and validation of computer systems. In our experience, industry and graduate programs alike value-above all-people who can solve real problems, and who come prepared to use the tools of their trade.  All students acquire a common background in the fundamental areas of computer science: computer systems, organization and architecture, algorithms and data structures, principles of software design, elements of the theory of computation, and operating systems. In addition, students obtain specialized backgrounds through the selection of five technical elective courses in computer science. Required and elective courses in the sciences and mathematics, along with additional courses in writing, humanities, social sciences, and the arts give students the opportunity to expand their horizons and to prepare for multi disciplinary careers.  There are very few areas in modem society untouched by computer science. Computer science is present in everything from health care, telecommunications, and entertainment, to transportation, education, and defense. The result of this diversity is that a computer scientist must be capable of working with people outside his or her field. In support of this, the Computer Science program provides its students with a well-rounded education requiring significant course work outside the Department of Computer Science, placing a strong emphasis on writing and communication skills.  Given the breadth and diversity of the computer science discipline, the Department of Computer Science also offers a computer systems option within the B.S. program in computer science. Computer systems represents a sub-specialty that provides more emphasis on understanding and designing computer hardware. The student continues to learn the fundamental areas of computer science: programming, data structures, discrete math, algorithms, formal languages, architecture, and operating systems. Unlike traditional computer science, however, the student also studies low- level circuit analysis and high-level system design, and has the option to take additional hardware-oriented courses. The result is a unique blend of computer science and computer engineering.       University of Illinois at Chicago 851 S.
