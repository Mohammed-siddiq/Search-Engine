             Brian Ziebart   Associate Professor  I am primarily interested in machine learning and its applications to problems in robotics, assistive technologies, and human-computer interaction.  I develop and apply new techniques for predicting structured data.  I was awarded a Ph.D. in Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon University in 2010.  Contact  Email:  bziebart@uic.edu (Please see Frequently Asked Questions first)  Office: 3190H Daley Library (3rd Floor, North)  Lab: 4211 Science and Engineering Laboratories  Teaching CS 411: Artificial Intelligence I -- Spring 2018 CS 401: Computer Algorithms I -- Fall 2014 , Fall 2017 CS 412.

CS 594: Advanced Topics in Machine Learning: Structured Prediction -- Fall 2013.   Research  Adversarial prediction : Approximating our training data and optimizing over the exact performance measure to provide greater flexibility for:  Learning under covariate shift (input distribution bias) and active learning; Cost-sensitive classification and inductive optimization of univariate performance measures; Learning to optimize for F-measure, discounted cumulative gain, and other multivariate performance measures; and Structured prediction problems over sequences, trees, graphs, etc.  Inverse optimal control : Using maximum entropy structured prediction techniques to forecast future human behavior for intelligent robotics and vehicle navigation applications.
