CS faculty members Troy, Theys, Eriksson, Taylor, Reed, Hayes, and Sloan celebrate their victory over the student teams at this year's Stump the Profs event, hosted by the ACM on April 10 in the CS Lounge.          text   UIC’s Association of Computing Machinery hosted Stump the Profs on Tuesday, April 10 in the CS Lounge. Teams made up of about 80 students had the opportunity to test their computer science knowledge against two faculty teams in a Jeopardy-style contest with categories ranging from programming to historical trivia.  ”This year was a landslide victory for the two faculty teams,” said Prof. Dale Reed, “in part because the historical trivia questions were from our lifetimes, but not our students’!”       pic      ­      Modified on March 20, 2019                          College of  Engineering         Contact   Phone: (312) 996-3422  info@cs.uic.edu    Webmaster  coecomm@uic.edu      Social Media Accounts                        UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC Today  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        Powered by Red 2.4.3  © 2019 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield      Cookie Settings
