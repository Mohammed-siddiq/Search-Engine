A Mosaic for UIC Transformation | Goal 7        A Leader in Higher Education Diversity Innovation   Unquestionably, the ultimate goal of transformative diversity is to make our campus a place where UIC’s commitment to equity, diversity, and social justice are evident: in our institutional policies and programs; in our equitable and transparent practices; in our welcoming climate where all feel they can thrive; in our engagement with the community; and most important, in the daily lives of every student, faculty, or staff member. UIC will be looked to as a model of diversity innovation and it should be prepared to share its successes and benefits with a wide audience.
