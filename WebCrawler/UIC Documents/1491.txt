We do this through intensive career development and transformative mentorship.  As a Mentor Coach , You…   Play an instrumental role in the career development of ANY Fellows, ambitious students who are the first in their families to attend college.  Mentor Coaches work alongside Fellows at monthly workshops, helping them cultivate their strengths, secure internships and overcome obstacles.  Specifically, Mentor Coaches help Fellows set and work towards professional goals, navigate the internship search/application process, broaden their professional networks, and work through unforeseen challenges. Mentor Coaches also attend 28 professional development workshops with Fellows.   Mentor Coaches and Fellows alike identify the mentoring experience as a unique and extremely special part of the ANY program.
