This is in lieu of a reception following the Honors College Convocation ceremony on Weds., May 8th, 2019, so we invite you to attend both celebratory events this year!    Come and enjoy the company of your graduating peers and the Honors College staff that have supported you along your undergraduate journey, as we celebrate a successful close of this chapter of your academic career. We'll have cake, an informal photo booth, music, and fun to honor all you've accomplished in your time with the Honors College and to help kick-start the season of commencement celebrations!    This event is open to all Honors College students graduating Spring 2019. The cake will be cut with a few remarks by Dean Keen at 3:15, but you are welcome to stop by any time before 5pm to enjoy the celebration, as your schedule allows.    Use the hashtag #uichonorsgrad to share photos and thoughts on social media leading up to and during graduation. Tweets, posts, and photos using that hashtag may even be shared on the screen during the celebration on May 3 rd !
