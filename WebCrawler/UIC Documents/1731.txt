The completed form must arrive in the Graduate College at least two weeks prior to the term for which the change is requested, however, most programs have earlier admission deadlines . UIC international students may use the program's domestic student deadline, unless the Office of International Services or the program advise otherwise.  The form must be signed by both the old and new (or second) programs.  The Office of International Services must also sign for international students on an F-1, J-1 or J-2 visa. Students should meet with the director of graduate studies of the new program to discuss procedures, deadlines, and credentials required. A Petition for Credit Towards An Advanced Degree (transfer credit)  listing all previously completed courses at UIC to be accepted by the new program should be attached to the Request for Change of Graduate Program Form , if applicable.  Currently enrolled graduate students and non-registered students with "continuing student" status who wish to transfer between the Graduate College (all programs), the School of Public Health (MPH, DrPH), the MBA Program, the Master of Engineering (professional MENG), and the Master of Social Work Program (MSW) must also use the Request for Change of Graduate Program Form .  While the form may not be used to transfer between levels (e.g. degree-seeking to non-degree, or graduate to professional), an exception is for changing to, or adding as a 2nd program, a campus certificate (which are classified as non-degree).  Complete instructions and deadline information are listed below. The form is available from your academic program office, the Graduate College, or the Graduate College website.                                 © Copyright 2016  The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois        Footer Menu   Privacy Policy  Support Graduate Education  My UIC.EDU  Contact Us  UIC           Follow Us   RSS Feed   Twitter  Facebook          Shibboleth login    Login
