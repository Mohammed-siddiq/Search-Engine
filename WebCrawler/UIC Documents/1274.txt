Tags: password , security Service: Computer Labs , Identity and Access Management , Helpdesk Services , Email and Calendaring , Exchange , Security Your NetID and associated password are the only credentials needed to access most University and campus networking and computing services.  Services such as the my.UIC portal , Blackboard , email , campus computer labs, printers and more.  Passwords are managed centrally via the IAM Password Management service.  Know your password and want to change it? Go to password.uic.edu   Don't know your password? Go to identity.uillinois.edu and select I forgot my password. Use pre-registered recovery options to reset your password.   Don't know your password and don't have recovery options registered? An in-person visit to an ACCC Service Desk is your only option.  Password resets are never made over the phone or through email. You must have your i-card with you.  Visit the C-stop Service Desk in the BSB Learning Center.  It's located on the first floor, Behavioral Sciences Building, 1007 West Harrison Street. Password assistance: Monday - Friday, 9:00am - 5:00pm  C-stop hours: Monday - Friday, 8:00am - 7:00pm​    Password Tips  Do not ever share your password with anyone, and do not send your password via email anyone (including any ACCC and other campus units).  Do not use personal information in your password that someone else is likely to be able to figure out. Obviously, things like your name, phone number, and address are to be avoided. Even names of acquaintances and the like should be avoided.  Do not use words, geographical names, or biographical names that are listed in standard dictionaries.  Never use a password that is the same as your account name.  Do not use passwords that are easy to spot while you're typing them in . Avoid passwords like 12345 , qwerty (i.e., all keys right next to each other), and nnnnnn .  Try This Trick  If you are having difficulty picking a good password, one good method is to use the first letter of each word in a phrase you can easily remember . For example, "McDonald's is your kind of place" is miykop . That will need some modification because you need an uppercase letter and a number too and it's not long enough, so how about: M'5iykop  Another method is to intentionally use misspelled words, or words with a number or punctuation mark suffixed. For example: Co77ege. (Since the password has to be at least 8 characters long, the period on the end is part of the password.)  Don't use these examples!  Common Mistakes  These are too easy to guess. Don't use them. (The dictionary check should take care of most of them, but even if it doesn't, please don't try.)  Your name  Your spouse's name  Your parent's name  Your pet's name  Your child's name  Names of close friends or coworkers  Names of your favorite fantasy characters  Your boss's name  Anybody's name  The name of the operating system you're using  The hostname of your computer  Your phone number  Your license plate number  Any part of your social security number  Anybody's birth date  Other information that is easily obtained about you  Words such as wizard, guru, gandalf, and so on.  Any username on the computer in any form (as is, capitalized, etc.)  A word in the English dictionary  A place  A proper noun  Passwords of all the same letter  Simple patterns on the keyboard, like qwerty  Any of the above spelled backwards  Any of the above preceded or followed by one or two digits  Need help?
