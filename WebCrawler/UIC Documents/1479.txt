ECE Professor Alan Feinerman has invented a new approach to insulation  April 5, 2014  UIC Professor Wears Two Hats: Inventor and Entrepreneur Alan Feinerman, professor of electrical engineering, has invented a new approach to insulation. Now he wants to market it through his start-up company. More than half of the energy consumed in the U.S. is used to keep people or food warm or cool. UIC electrical engineering professor Alan Feinerman worked with UIC’s Office of Technology Management to start his own company, Thermal Conservation Technologies (TCT). The goal is to commercialize an extremely compact and efficient thermal insulation made of a stainless steel “envelope” with Kevlar filaments inside. It is equivalent to the R-value of eight inches of polyurethane foam in less than one half inch, achieved by sealing the Kevlar filaments (patents…  More...
