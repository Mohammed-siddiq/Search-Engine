No matter what your major, a minor in CS is can enhance your professional qualifications in an increasingly interdisciplinary job market in which computing plays a central role.  The minor can focus on elective courses that are of interest to you. Course options include Game Design, Database Systems, Software Design, Visualization, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Hardware Organization, and Graphics.  The computer science minor is available to current UIC undergraduates and requires 15 to 17 credit hours, excluding prerequisite courses. This minor is not available to majors in either Computer Engineering or Mathematical Computer Science.
