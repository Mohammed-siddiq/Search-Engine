Their capacity for energy storage is well known, but so is their tendency to occasionally catch on fire – an occurrence known to battery researchers as “thermal runaway.” These fires occur most frequently when the batteries overheat or cycle rapidly. With more and more electric vehicles on the road each year, battery technology needs to adapt to reduce the likelihood of these dangerous and catastrophic fires.  Researchers from the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Engineering report that graphene — wonder material of the 21st century — may take the oxygen out of lithium battery fires.

Now, researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago have found that adolescent binge drinking, even if discontinued, increases the risk for anxiety later in life due to abnormal epigenetic programming. The findings of the study, which was conducted in animals, was published in the journal Biological Psychiatry.   Read full article »         Can a nerve injury trigger ALS?   A growing collection of anecdotal stories raises the possibility that nerve injury in an arm or a leg can act as a trigger for the development amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS — a progressive neurodegenerative disease also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, named after the famous New York Yankee who died of it in 1941.  Researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago are the first to demonstrate that a peripheral nerve injury can trigger the onset and spread of the disease in an animal model of ALS.

Produced by the Great Cities Institute at UIC, the report provides a framework for the region to plan and carry out future projects that deal with public health and the environment, social equity, and economic development. Additional features of the report include neighborhood demographic profiles, land use and zoning maps, and housing data.

His research and clinical practice have both focused on very severe cases of dry eye disease caused by autoimmune disorders, in particular by a condition known as ocular graft versus host disease, which is a serious complication that occurs in patients with blood cancers who have undergone stem cell or bone marrow transplants.  Read full profile           Kimberly Lawless, Professor 2017 Researcher of the Year, Distinguished - Social Sciences     Kimberly Lawless, associate dean for research in the College of Education, believes that science literacy is a tool, and like any tool, be it a hammer, screwdriver or wrench, you need to learn what it is, what it does and when to use it.  “If you go through the world thinking that you only have a hammer, the only thing you can do is hammer,” said Lawless, professor of educational psychology. “But if you go through life with a complement of tools and you are able to fluidly mix and match those tools to the job that’s in front of you, you’re going to better accomplish the job.”  Read full profile           Dima Mazen Qato, Assistant Professor 2017 Researcher of the Year, Rising Star - Social Sciences     For more than 10 years, Dima Qato worked as a retail pharmacist and witnessed countless examples of the vital role pharmacies play in the public health system, particularly when it comes to access to and safe use of medications.  However, while many like Qato consider pharmacies to be an essential part of our health care system, the independent and chain retailers are not regulated by or held accountable to any of the groups that provide checks and balances for other essential health services, like care in hospitals and clinics.  Read full profile           Isabel Cruz, Professor 2017 Researcher of the Year, Distinguished - Natural Sciences and Engineering     Isabel Cruz makes sense of complex data.  “One of the aspects I work on is heterogeneous data — for example, how to make sense of data that is collected with different spatial and temporal granularities,” said Cruz, professor of computer science.  The U.S. Census, for example, collects data every 10 years, but other population data within a city may be taken every month or year.  “So if you want to tell the story of what’s happening in a city, you cannot put apples and oranges together,” she said.  Read full profile           Richard Novak, Professor 2017 Researcher of the Year, Distinguished - Clinical Sciences     Richard Novak has been working to identify therapies and vaccines for HIV since the 1980s, when the infection first started making the news as it spread among the gay community.  Novak was a young assistant professor of infectious disease at UIC when he pushed for the hospital to open a dedicated HIV clinic because the general infectious disease department wasn’t able to handle the influx of HIV patients. That clinic opened in 1989, and just a few years later, Novak received funding to open UIC’s first dedicated HIV treatment and prevention clinics in the community in 1992.

That’s a question that Maria Argos aims to answer in her research studies.  Argos examines the levels of arsenic in drinking water primarily in Bangladesh, and the associated health effects for people who live there.

Subbaiah’s career has focused on analyzing the role of lipids — the molecules that make up fat in the body — for more than 40 years. His contributions have added to knowledge in several fields including Alzheimer’s disease and other neuroinflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis and metabolism.

Unlike many drug discovery labs, Moore’s lab investigates the way that proteins interact with one another in diseases.
