Kevin Browne  Vice Provost for Academic and Enrollment Services            Goals & Initiatives  The UIC Office of Academic and Enrollment Services (AES) strives to enroll and support the best possible incoming class for the UIC campus.  This year, AES focused on new initiatives to target high-achieving first-year applicants and to solidify transfer pathways.   Admissions Via Excellence           57  Admits      Admissions Via Excellence guarantees first-year applicants from Illinois high schools admission only if they rank in the top 4 percent of their graduating class. In Fall 2018, this avenue gave 57 applicants earlier notice of their admission status and their admission. In the regular review process, these students could have been denied due to poor ACT or SAT performance.  Twenty-nine of this year’s Admissions Via Excellence students submitted their Intent to Enroll (ITE) for Fall 2018 (an ITE yield rate of 51 percent), joining more than 300 other new students who graduated in the top 4 percent of their class.    ACCESS         54  Interview Admits      The Augmented College Criteria and Evaluation for Student Success (ACCESS) program introduces noncognitive factors that are linked to first-term GPA and persistence, for example, academic self-efficacy or the ability to thrive in the face of adversity. An on-campus interview and in-depth committee review identified  54 first-year applicants demonstrating leadership and commitment to their goals in their academic and personal lives. Thirty-eight of those applicants are expected to attend in Fall 2018 (an ITE yield rate of 70 percent).    Transfer Partnerships         36  TAG Admits           50  STAR Scholars      The Transfer Admission Guarantee (TAG) initiative builds a bridge between suburban community colleges and UIC. The Fall 2018 TAG cohort will be roughly twice the size of the first cohort in 2017.  UIC strengthened its relationship with students at the City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) with the Star Scholars program, which provides tuition coverage for high-achieving Chicago Public School (CPS) students enrolling in the City Colleges. Seventy percent of admitted Star Scholars accepted UIC's offer of admission for Fall 2018.    Slate CRM for Graduate and Professional Admissions          280+  Programs Managed           22,000+  Credentials Received           400  Candidate Interviews Scheduled      Graduate and Professional Admissions implemented the Slate CRM tool to streamline the admission process for Fall 2018 graduate and professional programs and beyond. Application processes are now more seamless for prospective students and staff, providing departments with greater access to application materials and data needed for reviewing candidates. A number of departments served as pilots for functionality (inbox communications, art portfolios, interview management and online enrollment deposit collection).  To collect more leads for recruitment, undergraduate admissions worked with the Graduate College to collect information for prospective students at fairs nationwide.        Success (Fall 2017–18)  AES units support processes, technology, and guidance for UIC student success.   Office of the Registrar         763,500+  Enrolled Credit Hours           7,500+  Degrees Conferred      The Office of the Registrar manages processes at all steps of the student life cycle.   Transfer students now receive their degree audits after being admitted. Nearly 3,000 Degree Audit Report System (DARS) audits were delivered by the Transfer Assistance Center.  The Office of Transfer Articulation and Degree Audit (TADA) oversaw the articulation of more than 15,000 transfer courses, fielded 1,350 help tickets, and made hundreds of revisions to courses and programs. In addition to a system upgrade from DARWin to uAchieve, 19 SCEP proposals were implemented during the 2017-18 academic year along with updated policies around CLEP and the State Seal of Biliteracy. 763,557 enrolled credit hours.  Classroom Scheduling arranged space in 37,462 gradable sections.  More than 7,500 degrees conferred in Fall 2017 and Spring 2018.  21,654 grade changes completed in the past year.  40,000+ transcripts ordered, with around 63 percent of the orders being electronically secured PDF files.     Student Success         88%  PAP Persistence Rate      The President's Award Program (PAP) offers weekly touch points related to the award criteria, which include maintaining good grades, participating in extracurricular activities, and visiting professor's office hours. The PAP Stem Initiative (PSI) provides additional programming for students in STEM majors. PAP students persist from freshman to sophomore year at a rate of 88 percent.  The PAP scholarship impacted me by providing resources and knowledge about what I can do to get ahead in college and secure what I need beyond my education, particularly career-oriented knowledge. (Michael, PAP STEM Initiative, Class of 2020)  The President's Award Program has encouraged me since freshman year to continue to grow as a student and leader on campus. The program has also afforded me the opportunity to give back and help others who are on a similar path. (Raashida, Class of 2018)  Being a part of [PAP] has allowed me to meet so many different people such as colleagues and faculty that have made my college experience a success. The breadth of resources that I have obtained by being a member of the President's Award Program has made a significant impact with regards to opportunities that have helped shape my career path and goals. (Neil, Class of 2018)        Outreach (Fall 2018)  Millions of interactions happen every year between AES staff and both prospective and incoming students.   Open House 2017         8,000+  Attendees*      On Sept. 16, 2017, roughly 8,000 visitors came to campus for the annual Open House. The event showcases UIC’s strengths in research, engagement, student life for prospective students and their families.  Campus tours, informational sessions, hands-on programs, and more opportunities are offered by specific colleges and departments.  * Includes guests    Targeted Recruitment Efforts         33  AARERI High Schools      The African American Recruitment, Enrollment, and Retention Initiative (AARERI) contacts and visits 33 area high schools. AARERI's on-campus events and programs contributed to a 14 percent increase in ITEs from African-American admits.

Outreach efforts concentrate largely in Chicago and the collar counties.  Admissions staff attend a total of 792 college fairs, school visits, and events. An additional 200 visits this year stretched UIC's reach to other regions in the U.S. and the world.

Print and promotional materials, such as event invitations, postcards and viewbooks for parents, supplemented or substituted these interactions. Online, recruiters actively engaged with prospective applicants through chat, digital streams, email, and phone counseling.        Review (Spring–Fall 2018)  The Spring, Summer, and Fall 2018 terms saw more than 51,000 applications submitted across all student levels.

The review process evolved in Slate with more than 100,000 file reviews by Admissions counselors and college readers.

The program focuses on recruiting historically underrepresented minorities, students with no estimated family financial contribution towards college, or applicants from low-sending counties in Illinois. 914 awards were offered to the most competitive applicants in the pool. Fall 2017 will see 292 new PAP "accepts" who have completed pre-enrollment requirements to receive the award.  The Merit Tuition Rate, also known as the Chicago Grant, reduces the financial burden for high-achieving, domestic, non-illinois residents. More than 2,100 Chicago Grants were offered to admitted undergraduates with 327 first-year and transfer recipients expected on campus in the fall.    International Applications         2,000+  Fall 2018 Undergraduate Degree-Seeking International Applications           495  Fall 2018 Undergraduate Degree-Seeking International Intents to Enroll      First-Year international applications for Fall 2018 saw a 3 percent increase compared to Fall 2017.
