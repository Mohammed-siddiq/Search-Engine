GRE Requirement – Applicants who have an undergraduate degree from a foreign institution must submit GRE scores. Applicants who have an undergraduate degree from a US institution are not required to provide GRE scores. However if they feel that their performance in GRE will be strong enough to significantly enhance prospects for admission or financial aid, then they are encouraged to take the exam. Applicants are generally expected to have scores of at least 160 (new scale) or 750 (old scale) on the quantitative part of the general exam. Applicants should have ETS report the general test scores of the GRE to institution code 1851. Graduate Admission - Master of Science (MS)  Prior Degrees – Applicants seeking admission to the MS program in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) should have an undergraduate degree from an accredited college or university in Electrical Engineering (EE) or Computer Engineering (CE) or in a related field.  GPA – To be admitted with full standing to the MS program, an applicant is expected to have a Grade Point Average (GPA) of at least 3.0 out of 4.0 in the final 60 semester hours (final 90 quarter hours) of undergraduate study. In addition, applicants should have completed substantial coursework in the chosen field of study.Applicants with a bachelor’s degree in EE or CE or a related curriculum and an outstanding academic record, with a GPA above 3.5/4.0, are encouraged to seek admission directly to the PhD program.  Limited Standing – At the discretion of the admissions committee, promising applicants who do not meet all of the requirements for full standing may be admitted on a limited standing status. Graduates of scientifically oriented curricula other than Electrical Engineering or Computer Engineering must show substantial evidence of their ability to successfully complete the ECE graduate program. Depending on individual qualifications and academic history, such applicants will be required to complete one or more deficiency courses. Incoming graduate students are expected to have completed the equivalent of the undergraduate major sequence for EE or CE. Click here for list of UIC CE undergraduate major sequence  Click here for list of UIC EE undergraduate major sequence Students with strong academic backgrounds who have not completed the equivalent of the major sequence of courses may be admitted on limited standing status. Ordinarily, this option is restricted to students who are missing at most two or three courses from the list of courses in the major sequence. Students who are admitted on limited standing will be required to complete a set of specific deficiency courses in order to be elevated to full standing graduate status. Students must remove their deficiency within their first year in the ECE graduate program, and must receive grades of A or B in these courses in order to continue in the graduate program. Applicants may also be admitted on limited standing status if the TOEFL score is low, or if the GPA is below the threshold. These students must meet the conditions specified in the admission letter. After fulfilling requirements to attain full standing the student should petition for a status change, from limited to ful. It is the student’s responsibility to submit a request for status change in the Student Affairs Office of the ECE Department. Applicants who plan to take only undergraduate deficiency courses should consider applying for admission either to the undergraduate program or as a non-degree student. Admission to non-degree status does not obligate the Graduate College or the ECE Department to later admit a student to a degree program. Only domestic students may be admitted, and only in exceptional circumstances, on non-degree status.
