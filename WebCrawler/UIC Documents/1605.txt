Graduate Catalog - Official published (static) version  The information in the Archived Published Catalog links provided below consists of exact copies of the information published in the archived Graduate Catalogs for the years listed. The listings under Archived Published Catalogs remain static and are only for reference for students, alumni, faculty, and staff who may have a need to view this type of information.  When students matriculate into a graduate program at UIC they are subject to the rules and requirements of the published printed catalog in effect at that time (some exceptions apply). If program requirements or other regulations are changed after a student matriculates, the student has the right to fulfill the original requirements listed in the published catalog in effect at the time when that student initially matriculated into a program.
