Prior to joining UIC, I spent a few years in industry as a data scientist, working on large-scale recommender systems, personalization , incentivized sharing, and data science tools for journalists . I built and led the data science team at LivingSocial, and later was a principal data scientist at Vox Media. I also spent a year in government as an AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow at the National Science Foundation, contributing to national initiatives at the intersection of data science and public policy. Many of the research problems I am interested to solve are informed by my industry and public policy experience. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2011 from the University of Maryland, College Park where my advisor was Lise Getoor.    RESEARCH INTERESTS  My research spans different aspects of data science , including machine learning, causal inference, graph mining, network science, and privacy. My research goal is to unify these aspects in a single framework that allows us to reason better with data and solve important societal problems. I am especially interested in algorithms for heterogeneous graphs and networks, with focus on:   How we can improve machine learning methods by addressing bias in (found) data  How we can build cohesive data science frameworks that include both causal inference and machine learning  How we can empower people in their privacy choices through personalized privacy assistants   I am motivated by compelling applications, and some of the areas that I study are personalization, social media, social networks, journalism, and e-commerce.
