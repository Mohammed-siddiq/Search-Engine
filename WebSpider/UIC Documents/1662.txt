ABSTRACT: Very little information exists about how research departments function in commercial companies and organizations. What do their researchers do? How free are they to choose the topics of their research? Who is promoted in these departments? What is their measurement of success? How protected are their employees from the whims of their upper management? BIO: Dr. Grechanik  worked for many commercial companies and organizations before he joined UIC as a full-time professor.
