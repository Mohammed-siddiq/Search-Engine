Do you have a question that is not on this list? Email us at gradapps@cs.uic.edu      Am I eligible for admission to your program?         1   Admissions requirements vary by program. Visit our MS in Computer Science page or our PhD in Computer Science page for specifics.        What happens if I do not meet the admissions criteria in one or two areas?         1   Our admissions committee reviews all complete applications, regardless of whether all criteria are met. No matter what, the committee evaluates each person’s overall academic record and all materials submitted. Consider applying even if you do not meet a couple of the criteria. Please note that we neither guarantee admission if you do meet the criteria nor guarantee denial if you do not meet all the criteria. All decisions are on a case-by-case basis.        How do I apply for financial aid?         How do I apply for financial aid?   First, we encourage you to read our webpage about financial aid . All applicants automatically are considered for the forms of financial aid described on this webpage for which they are eligible. You do not need to submit a separate financial aid application. You do, however, need to submit GRE scores with your application to be considered for financial aid (see the next question for more information).        If I have a degree from a U.S. institution, do I need to take the GRE?         If I have a degree from a U.S. institution, do I need to take the GRE?   The GRE exam is not mandatory for students who have degrees from U.S. universities and who do not want to be considered for financial aid . If you do want to be considered for financial aid, including fellowships and assistantships, you must submit your GRE score. Please note that the admissions committee may contact applicants who already have submitted their applications to request GRE scores if the committee members decide they do need this information to render a decision.        When do I need to submit my transcripts?         When do I need to submit my transcripts?   If you are admitted to our graduate programs, you must submit your original transcripts (or attested transcripts) to UIC’s Office of Admissions and Records to officially be admitted to the university. More information will be sent to accepted students.        When do international students need to submit their financial and bank statements?         1   These statements are not needed at the time of application. Students who are accepted and choose to attend UIC will need to submit documentation to the university’s Office of International Services after they decide to attend.        What happens after I submit my application?         1    Once you complete your online application, UIC’s Office of Admissions and Records (OAR) will send you a confirmation in three to five business days. At this point, you can log back into the application system to upload the supplemental materials required by the department and type in the email addresses of your recommenders.  Your recommenders then will get an email notification of your application, including a link to upload the recommendation letter.  OAR and the computer science department will periodically check applications for acceptability of the documents submitted. You should check your application status periodically as well to see if there are any issues with the materials submitted and if your application is complete.  Once the application is considered complete by OAR and department, the graduate admissions committee will review your application and make a decision. Once a decision is made, a letter will be sent to the email you provided on your application.         How do I find out the status of my application?         1   You can monitor the status of your application on the admissions website. If you are unable to log into the website, you can email us at grad@cs.uic.edu , including your University ID number (UIN), first name, last name, and date of birth, and we can send you a status update by email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days to receive a reply. Please note that if you are unable to get the information from the admissions system and you are sending us an email, you must write to us from the email account listed on your application. We will not provide application information or status to anyone other than you. There are no exceptions to this policy.        I sent an email to grad@cs.uic.edu and have not received a reply. What do I do?         1   Be patient. We respond to all email, but there are hundreds of other applicants just like you who are looking for information. We may need up to 10 business days before we can respond to your e-mail. Please do not send multiple e-mails. When we give a time period for our response, please wait for that time to elapse before contacting us again.        I received an acceptance to my UIC CS program of choice. When will I find out about financial aid?         I received an acceptance to my UIC CS program of choice. When will I find out about financial aid?   If you are selected for a fellowship or teaching assistantship, you will be contacted by March for fall admissions. (Please note that no fellowships are available for spring admissions). We contact only applicants who are offered aid.        How can I apply for research assistantships?         1   You will need to wait until you are admitted to look into research assistantships. If you have received an acceptance letter, you can then contact faculty in your area of research interest to ask about possible openings. If the faculty members are hiring research assistants and are interested in learning more about you as a candidate, they will contact you.
