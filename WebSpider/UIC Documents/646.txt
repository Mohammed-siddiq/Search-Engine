The homepage featured the endangered Grevy’s zebra, an animal whose population Wildbook has aimed to help conserve using AI and crowd-sourced photography. Wildbook is a part of Wild Me , an established non-profit that Berger-Wolf oversees with her team of conservation enthusiasts. The group has helped take a more accurate census of thousands of endangered species, including giraffes, elephants, and whale sharks, among others.  In addition to the featured image, Bing hosted a three-question quiz for users to test their zebra knowledge. Wildbook’s collaboration with Bing stems from its relationship with parent company Microsoft.  Microsoft recently announced Wild Me as one of their five featured projects for its AI for Earth initiative, which includes a $50 million commitment toward utilizing AI to help protect the planet and its inhabitants.       links                                               Modified on April 02, 2019                          College of  Engineering         Contact   Phone: (312) 996-3422  info@cs.uic.edu    Webmaster  coecomm@uic.edu      Social Media Accounts                        UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC Today  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        Powered by Red 2.4.3  © 2019 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield      Cookie Settings
