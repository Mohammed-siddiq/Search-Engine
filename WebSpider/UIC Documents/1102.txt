School on its own would not have shown me what project management or design build could be.”   ~ Kitty, Senior, Civil Eng. (Featured in the photo with her mentor)   “My mentor has given a lot of insight in all the questions I have been asking. We mostly talk about school stuff and research.” ~Danilo, Senior, Computer Eng.  “My mentor has been great. We had phone conversations once every couple of weeks. He has given me excellent advice regarding school, projects, and finding a job. I even got a tour of his work place and what they do.” ~ Xiong, Senior, Electrical Eng.  “I received a plethora of advice regarding the real world and the experiences encountered by my mentor that has, quite honestly, helped me immensely. His experience regarding graduate school helped me to open my eyes at the possibility of going myself. I am immensely fortunate to have spoken to such a humble and wise individual.” ~ Brandon, Senior, Mechanical Eng.
