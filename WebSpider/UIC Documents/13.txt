Course Option      In the course option, students complete all the credit hours toward the MS in Computer Science through coursework.   36 semester hours of coursework, of which 16 hours must be computer science courses at the 500 level (excluding CS 590 and CS 595-599).  A maximum of 8 semester hours of non-computer-science graduate courses may be counted toward the overall coursework requirement if prior approval is received from the department via a formal petition.  Only one special topics course (CS 594) may be used to satisfy the 500-level requirement.     Go to course catalog         Project Option      The project option allows students to demonstrate their learning in the form of a substantive capstone project that is advised by a faculty member and evaluated by the advisor and one other faculty member. The project work and a required summary report must demonstrate a high level of professional skill, but students do not need to formally present or defend their projects. Requirements are as follows:   32 semester hours of coursework, of which 12 hours must be computer science courses at the 500 level (excluding CS 590 and CS 595-599).  4 semester hours of CS 597  A maximum of 8 semester hours of non-computer-science graduate courses may be counted toward the overall coursework requirement if prior approval is received from the department via a formal petition.  Only one special topics course (CS 594) may be used to satisfy the 500-level requirement.   Students who are pursuing the project option can find full details about requirements and policies of the project below.    Go to Project Option         Thesis Option      The MS Thesis option is designed for graduate students with an interest in Computer Science research. Students selecting this option conduct original research under the supervision of a faculty member, culminating in the writing of a MS thesis. At the completion of the thesis, the student presents a thesis defense to the Thesis Committee, who are responsible for reviewing and evaluating the research work. The MS Thesis option is strongly advised for students who may be interested in pursuing a PhD in the future. Requirements are as follows:   28 semester hours of coursework, of which 12 hours must be computer science courses at the 500 level (excluding CS 590 and CS 595-599).  8 semester hours of CS 598, through which the student conducts original research and writes a master’s thesis.  A maximum of 8 semester hours of non-computer-science graduate courses may be counted toward the overall coursework requirement if prior approval is received from the department via a formal petition.  Only one special topics course (CS 594) may be used to satisfy the 500-level requirement.   Thesis students are strongly encouraged to publish their original research in professional journals and to present their work at professional conferences.  Students who are pursuing the thesis option can find full details about requirements and policies of the thesis below.    Go to Thesis Option         No Comprehensive Examination   There are no comprehensive examinations in any of the three options within the MS in Computer Science program.           MS students win Mobility Hackathon Chicago with “Feel Your City”  Five MS in Computer Science students won the top prize at Mobility Hackathon Chicago , sponsored by Bosch and KPMG. Their winning platform and device—which they named “Feel Your City”—can collect, visualize, and analyze data about air quality and noise pollution in major metropolitan areas.
