It’s not hard to see why. Computer science is helping self-driving cars to drive safely, allowing us to create beautiful visualizations of complex information, finding new ways to keep our personal information safe, enabling us to talk to our appliances and phones, and so much more.  This is an extremely rich and diverse discipline. If you are interested in studying computer science, the UIC curriculum will ensure that you have the depth and preparation that will allow you to pursue whatever career goal you may have, from data mining to video-game design to artificial intelligence.  Why is computer science housed in UIC’s College of Engineering? It’s a natural fit. Engineering is about using scientific and mathematical knowledge to enable the design and creation of complex products, and computers are one of our most powerful tools for design and creation.  A degree in computer science from UIC will allow you to understand theory and practice, so that you have the power to analyze, imagine, design, and create the programs that will shape what we experience in the future.       Mahmooda Ali        “UIC is a diverse college with people from all around the world, so not only do I learn about computer science, I also learn something new about different cultures every day. UIC also has a wonderful selection of professors with many accomplishments who genuinely care about their students. I wanted to be challenged, and with UIC’s ABET-accredited programs, I knew that I would be pushed to work at my highest potential.”    Mahmooda Ali | BS in Computer Science          What can we teach you about computer science?      You can think about computer science as a widely varied field that spans a large spectrum. At one end of that spectrum, computer science can be defined as the study of what can be done with computation and what resources are required for that. At the other end of the spectrum, computer science can be defined as how to apply knowledge, hardware, and software to solve human and social needs.  Can you think of problems in our society or in your community that could benefit from a creative solution? What bothers you in the world? With a computer science education, you might be able to come up with a creative technological solution.  The UIC computer science department will train you to understand computer science at both ends of the spectrum that stretches across this fascinating field. At UIC, you will build a broad background that will serve you well into your career. You will become familiar with critical theories that underlie computer science, and you will develop applied skills in the design, implementation and validation of computer systems.  In our experience, industry jobs and graduate programs value, above all, people who can solve real problems come prepared to use the tools of their trade.      luis    I chose the College of Engineering because computer science at UIC is at the top of its field. One thing UIC does better than anyone else is keeping an up-to-date curriculum—it pushes students’ limits, and then beyond that. I advise students to find computer science friends you can work with: collaboration is the key to passing.    Luis Samayoa | BS in Computer Science        ABET Accreditation   The undergraduate programs in computer science at UIC are accredited by ABET, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology . ABET encourages its member schools to publicly share with all of you the student outcomes that we expect from our programs—in other words, the knowledge and abilities that we anticipate our undergraduate computer science students will have by the time they complete the program. We expect that UIC CS graduates will be able to:   Analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.  Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.  Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.  Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.  Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s discipline.  Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions.
