UIC is part of a three campus system under the University of Illinois : the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where the university was founded in 1867; the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), formed in 1982 by the merger of the former Medical Center campus and the former Chicago Circle campus; and the University of Illinois at Springfield (UIS), established in 1995 when the university assumed Sangamon State University.  The Faculty Handbook is published and maintained by the Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs , which reports to the Provost/Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs , who is the chief academic officer for the campus. This Handbook gives current, new, and prospective faculty members a convenient guide to useful information about the University of Illinois at Chicago and its policies, the use of various facilities and services, and the campus environment.  This Handbook provides a navigational aid to brief descriptions of existing policies, procedures and resources, rather than a complex text. The reader should use the hyperlinks provided within the Handbook to the various website resources. For questions regarding information on this site or for assistance in locating specific information not found at this site, please contact Faculty Affairs, ayudt@uic.edu .    Disclaimer: The Handbook contains policies and procedures in place as of the date of publication. They are subject to change, modification, interpretation, and elimination at any time as a result of action by federal and/or state governments, by the trustees of the University of Illinois and by the university administration. Not all situations will be covered; where policies do not apply or do not exist, the university retains its inherent right to create new policies and manage the university through its administration and board of trustees.                © Copyright 2013-2019 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois      Footer Navigation   University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System UIC Flames University of Illinois Alumni Association Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Privacy Policy  Contact Us  Contact the Webmaster
