A Brief History of the Diversity Strategic Thinking Process.   In the fall of 2008, the Provost sought nominations from Deans and Vice Chancellors of individuals to serve on a campus-level Diversity Strategic Thinking and Planning Committee (DSTP). The committee met with campus constituencies to gain perspective on campus diversity issues. Each campus activity was assessed to find opportunities to further support diversity. They were assessed in six areas: (1) Environment/Climate, (2) Faculty, (3) Research, (4) Staff, (5) Students, (6) Teaching and Learning. Students were also encouraged to participate in the DSTP process through the creation of a Student Advisory Committee. The DSTP was split into two phases:  Phase I started in January of 2009. The goal of the first stage, Diversity Strategic Thinking, was to consider how UIC interprets, accomplishes, assesses, and utilizes our diversity. A formal document outlining campus diversity was drafted in early 2010, called Through the Lens of Diversity. Current activities and future priorities were shared and discussed in a series of town hall meetings*. Communications with students, faculty, and staff provided the foundation for stage two of the process in which a campus and college/unit Diversity Strategic Plan were developed.  Phase II began in June of 2010. The second stage, Diversity Strategic Planning, articulates the university’s diversity agenda. The university’s vision, mission, goals, and aims were outlined, along with the programs, policies, and activities to guide UIC toward their goals. Each college and administrative unit has a Diversity Strategic Plan that communicates their distinctive agenda, collaboratively called Mosaic for UIC Transformation. Also included in this phase were approaches and mechanisms for regular assessment of progress and effectiveness.
