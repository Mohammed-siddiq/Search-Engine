Students follow a specific curriculum and meet established performance criteria to maintain their admission guarantee.  With the security of GPPA, students are able to focus on undergraduate studies and have the freedom to pursue many subject areas and disciplines. In addition, participants have early and frequent contact with professional school faculty and advisors. Most students in GPPA also benefit from the facilities and services of the UIC Honors College.           INFORMATION SESSIONS   Honors College and GPPA Staff conduct information sessions at the UIC Visitors Center on a regular basis. These sessions include an overall presentation on both the Honors College and GPPA, including the admissions process, program requirements, and resources. There is also time for students to ask individual questions.  Sessions are held at the UIC Visitors Center on a regular basis from July through January.
