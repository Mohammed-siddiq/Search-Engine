Both sets of printers are functionally the same, and follow the same procedures and safety precautions.  Materials:  PLA – good all around material with minimal warping. Most parts should be printed with PLA. Eco-ABS – Higher strength and heat deflection tempurature. Contains no ABS and is actually a form of PLA.  Nylon – More flexible and stronger than Eco-ABS or PLA – however warping is significant.  Use and Limitations: The Dremel 3D printers  have an approximate maximum build volume of: 10” x 6” x 6.7” (255 mm x 155 mm x 170 mm).  The material used for these printers is polylactic acid (PLA), which comes in an assortment of colors as shown below. Printing services are open for academic use to any UIC College of Engineering students. This means the Makerspace staff will gladly assist you in printing any parts necessary for class projects or prototyping purposes. No extensive knowledge of 3D printing is necessary. The Makerspace staff can walk you through any print, as well as deny any printing service if they believe your part/parts are unreasonable in terms of printing capabilities or purpose.  What you need to bring: Bring an STL file on a flash drive. The STL should be exported according to the instructions on the Filetypes and CAD page.  Options available: You can choose between many colors for your print. If you are unsure Black or White are the default colors.  You can choose the layer height for your print. 300um prints more quickly and is a stronger part at the cost of detail. 200um preserves more fine details but take longer to print.  You can choose infill percentage for your part. The default is 20%. More infill does not necessarily mean a stronger part. Infills greater than 50% are rarely necessary.  If you need additional customization our staff can assist you in choosing the best settings for your part. Usually we’ll print one using default settings so we can analyze the failure.  Safety:  The machines have parts that exceed 200C when printing – they will burn you on contact. Be mindful of the printing nozzle and never touch it with your hands  The machines can also move unexpectedly and with great force – keep hands away from machine when the machine is building an object.
