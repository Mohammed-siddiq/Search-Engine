UIC, as a community which prides itself on its rich diversity, condemns this violence and believes no one should endure such tragedy or loss. During this challenging time, we are woefully reminded that tragedy can happen anywhere and yet affect people everywhere.  Even as we endure this senseless event, we encourage you to live the values of a global university — to be inclusive, treat each other with dignity and respect, and promote citizenship.  Without these values, we could not build and advance our campus community.  To honor the lives of the victims and give space to those impacted by the tragedy, a vigil will be held Wednesday, April 24, at 1:45 p.m. at the Newman Center lawn (700 S. Morgan St., between BSB and the Daley Library).
