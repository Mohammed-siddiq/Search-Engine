Organized as working groups, these interdisciplinary efforts recognize the points of interconnection around phenomena that are important in our society and world.  The goal of UIC Engineering’s interdisciplinary working groups is to bring together faculty members with specific interests and expertise, use regular meetings as forums to explore and share cutting-edge research, and develop ideas for research projects and grant proposals.             Working groups are facilitated by the associate dean of research and graduate studies; faculty from all six departments are invited to take part in groups that resonate with their research agendas. A faculty liaison serves as a point of contact for each working group. Doctoral students are invited to join working groups based on the recommendations of their advisors.      Interdisciplinary working groups:   Autonomous Vehicles Working Group     For more information about interdisciplinary collaboration at UIC Engineering, please contact Venkat Venkatakrishnan, associate dean of research and graduate studies, at venkat@uic.edu . For more information about a specific working group, please reach out to the faculty liaison specified on the working group’s main page.
