Lecture Capture      Category: Learning Tools Audience: Faculty , Staff , IT , ACCC Request Lecture Capture Overview UIC provides all faculty and instructors with a free and easy-to-use lecture capture tool called Echo360 ALP. Along with features provided by the tool, UIC faculty have access to support, learning workshops, and personal consultations.  The captures created from Echo360 ALP can be linked to  Blackboard Learn and accessed via Echo 360.org  Features Echo360 provides faculty with two distinct lecture capture options that facilitate blended learning:  1. Classroom Capture 2. Personal Capture   RECORD  Classroom Capture allows instructors to easily record lectures taught in specific classrooms and make them available to their students electronically via Blackboard learn or Echo360.org.  The system will capture all audio and video sources in the classroom’s multimedia system, including the installed PC, an instructor’s laptop, the built-in and wireless microphones, and more.  Personal Capture allows you to record captures using a stand-alone application that runs on Windows and Mac computers. Personal Capture allows instructors to record a webcam video or simply record audio and their computer screen simultaneously, which allows adding sound to PowerPoint presentations and other course material.   EDIT  All recorded captures can be modified in your dashboard and tailored for your lecture and student needs.  PUBLISH  Captures created from both of these options can be linked to  Blackboard Learn and also accessed at Echo360.org. Echo360 ALP provides the instructor with reports on student activities such as viewing of Echoes and participation in discussions, and polling.  Recorded captures are kept on Echo 360’s servers for a period of four years before being removed.
