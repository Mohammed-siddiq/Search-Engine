For over a decade artist Eric J. Garcia has inked visuals with the sharpest of political critiques made through a Chicano lens. Known for blending history and culture with contemporary politics, Garcia creates art that reaches beyond aesthetics. Join us as we celebrate Drawing on Anger: Portraits of U.S. Hypocrisy , a collection of García’s most unabashed political cartoons about U.S. history and politics from 2004 to the present.  Garcia reconstructs pivotal moments in history—such as U.S. complicity in the disappearance of the forty-three Ayotzinapa Mexican students, genocide and torture in Iraq, and femicide along the U.S. Mexico border. His work reflects on the larger themes of anti-immigration laws, global imperialism, veterans affairs, and the conquest of the Americas.  Eric J. Garcia is known for mixing history and culture with contemporary themes. He always tries to create art that is much more than just aesthetics. Garcia has exhibited nationally, including institutions like the National Museum of Mexican Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit. He received his BFA with a minor in Chicano studies from the University of New Mexico, and his MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
