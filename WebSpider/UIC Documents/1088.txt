But UIC knows that you have what it takes to make it happen! We’ve created a special Saturday event for female freshmen and sophomores that is designed to help you target and work through any obstacles you might encounter in your future classes and career.  Mark your calendar for April 13, 2019. In five short hours on campus, you will make connections with engineers and executives from Knowles Corporation and other firms, learn new strategies for success, and develop a clear vision of where your UIC degree can take you.  We are grateful for the support of Knowles, which also sponsors scholarships for female UIC Engineering students and the Women in Engineering Summer Program. The company is a longstanding advocate of women in engineering.  The workshop is open on a first-come, first-served basis. We encourage you to join us !  Participants  If you are a female freshman or sophomore majoring in engineering or computer science at UIC, this event is for you! We have mapped out an agenda that will give you the outlook and skills you need to make it happen in your classwork, your future job, and life in general.
