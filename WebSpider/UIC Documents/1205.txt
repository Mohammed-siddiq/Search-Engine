We have equipment and services to help support College of Engineering undergraduate students in prototyping and manufacturing for class work and student organizations. We also support graduate research on a very limited basis (requires project approval).  If you have questions about what file types to bring, where we are located, what classes we offer, or what machines we have you can refer to the pages linked in the header for more information.
