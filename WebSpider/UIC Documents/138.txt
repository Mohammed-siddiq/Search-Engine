Coursework Requirements      Students admitted with a prior master’s degree in computer science or a related field must complete at least 28 of those hours from coursework, 16 hours of which must be computer science courses at the 500 level (excluding CS 590 and CS 595-599). UIC’s Graduate College may grant up to 32 hours of credit from previously earned MS degree; students must submit a request to Student Affairs for these credits upon enrollment at UIC.  Students who are directly admitted after a bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field must complete at least 32 hours from coursework, 16 hours of which must be computer science courses at the 500 level (excluding CS 590 and CS 595-599).  Important notes:   Courses that are nearly equivalent to computer science graduate courses should not be repeated. Generally, repeated courses will not earn PhD credit.  A maximum of 8 hours of non-computer science graduate courses may be counted toward the overall coursework requirement, but prior approval via a formal petition is required. Consult the Student Affairs office in 905 SEO for details on petitions.  A maximum of two special topics courses (CS 594) may be counted toward the 500-level coursework requirement. Students may submit a petition to use additional special topics courses toward other coursework requirements.        Research Credits   Students admitted with a prior master’s degree in computer science or a related field must earn at least 48 hours of the program total from research hours.  Students who are directly admitted after a bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field must earn at least 72 hours of the program total from research hours.  Important notes:   Research Methods is required. Candidates must earn 4 hours in CS 590 within the first two years of enrollment.  Colloquium is required for a minimum of 10 sessions within the first two years of enrollment. Attending other students’ dissertation defenses may be counted toward colloquia.  Only 48 or 72 research hours, respectively, may be used toward the PhD in computer science, but students may register for additional hours with permission from their faculty advisor if needed.        prereq     Qualifier Examination   PhD students must pass the qualifier examination before the end of their fourth semester of enrollment. See the Qualifier Examination page for full details.     Preliminary Examination   PhD students must pass an oral preliminary examination on their proposed dissertation topic. In this examination, students must demonstrate a capacity for independent research on an original dissertation topic within the selected field of study. Visit the Preliminary Examination page for full details.     Dissertation   Upon completion of all degree requirements and the dissertation, students must orally defend their work before the committee. Visit the Dissertation Process page for full details.          Additional PhD Policies and Procedures     Advisor         Advisor   All PhD students are assigned a temporary advisor upon admission. Students are encouraged to choose a permanent advisor by their second semester. By the completion of the third semester, a formal Permanent Advisor selection form must be submitted to the CS Student Affairs office. Permanent advisors must be chosen by mutual agreement.        PhD Assessment         PhD Assessment   All PhD students are required to complete the College of Engineering’s annual online self-assessment . Students are notified when the self-assessment is open. It requires demographic information, self-evaluation, publications, presentations, and plans for the upcoming year.  Once the student completes and submits the survey, the advisor receives a notification that allows him or her to verify and provide feedback on the student’s progress.        Registration         Registration   General registration policies are outlined by the Graduate College . Upon passing the preliminary examination, PhD students are required to register for at least zero credit hours each semester (excluding summer) until the dissertation defense is completed and the dissertation is submitted in compliance with department and Graduate College rules. If the PhD candidate decides to defend during the summer, registration is required for the summer term. PhD candidates are not required to register after they successfully defend their dissertation unless registration is required to maintain a specific status (e.g., research or teaching assistantship, visa, or continued use of university facilities).  If a PhD candidate successfully defends the dissertation and submits the final dissertation to the Graduate College after the semester deadline but prior to the fifth day of instruction of the following semester, the degree is conferred in the subsequent semester. Registration for that subsequent semester is not required.  See http://grad.uic.edu/zero-hour-registration for further details.        Time Restrictions         Time Restrictions   Students admitted to the Graduate College with a master’s degree or who continue in the Graduate College after completing a master’s degree at UIC must complete the degree requirements within seven consecutive calendar years after initial registration as a doctoral student. Students admitted to the Graduate College without a master’s degree who proceed directly from the bachelor’s degree to the doctorate must complete degree requirements within nine consecutive calendar years of initial registration as a doctoral student. Students who do not graduate by these deadlines will be dismissed from the Graduate College for failure to progress. Time spent on a leave of absence approved by the program and the Graduate College is not counted toward the degree time limit.        Transfer Credit         Transfer Credit   After admission to the PhD program, students may petition to transfer coursework not used for any previous degree. A maximum of 9 semester hours earned outside the computer science department are eligible for transfer; credits from non-U.S. institutions are generally not allowed. A transcript showing the courses with grades and course syllabi must be submitted with the transfer credit petition. Upon request, students also must provide an official letter from the university stating that the course(s) were not used to satisfy any prior degree requirements. Students changing from “non-degree” to “degree” status at UIC may petition for up to 12 semester hours of credit earned. Only graduate level courses in which a grade of “A” or “B” was earned will be eligible for transfer. Transfer credit from outside UIC is not allowed once a student starts his or her graduate studies in the computer science program at UIC.        Transfers to the MS program         Transfers to the MS program   The UIC College of Engineering strategic plan states that students in a PhD program who have received any financial support from UIC—such as a teaching assistantship, research assistantship, fellowship, or tuition and fee waiver—cannot transfer into any MS program in the College of Engineering, which includes computer science, without an approved petition.        Interim master’s degrees         Interim master’s degrees   PhD candidates admitted directly into the PhD program following their bachelor’s degree do NOT earn an MS degree on the way to their PhD. They graduate only with a PhD degree.        Prior publication of research findings         Prior publication of research findings   Students engaged in research may choose to publish certain findings that are later incorporated into the final dissertation. In such cases, appropriate acknowledgment of the earlier publication should be included in the dissertation. The Graduate College encourages such publication, but the dissertation may not be published in its entirety before all degree requirements, including the defense of the dissertation, have been completed.
