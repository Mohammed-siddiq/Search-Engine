  Bayesian Online Multilabel Classification (BOMC)    version 1.0  September 29, 2011  Overview  BOMC is an open source toolkit  for online multilabel classification using 
Bayesian models [1, 2].  It is implemented in F# 1.9.3.4 on Microsoft 
Visual Studio 2008, and can be compiled and run on Linux systems via Mono .  The graphical 
model, as shown in Figure 1~3 of [1], is extend from TrueSkill TM [2] 
to deal with multilabel, and the inference engine is expectation propagation.  We refer the interested users to two other illustrative F# implementations of 
TrueSkill TM : original [2] and temporal [3].  Download  BOMC version
