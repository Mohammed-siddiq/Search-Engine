International students constitute about a quarter of total graduate students at UIC.  1.  Applicants to graduate study at UIC must use the online application form . Applications and supporting credentials should be submitted as early as possible. Applications received after the deadline will not be accepted. Note that some graduate programs have application deadlines that are earlier than the University deadline, and some admit students only in specific terms (e.g. fall term only). Prospective applicants should contact the program of interest for information on current deadlines, as some programs may close earlier than the published deadlines .  Applicants must upload all supporting documents via the link provided.  Please refer to http://oar.uic.edu/grad/document_upload  for information.  A few days after submission of the online application and email is sent to the applicant with instructions on the upload process.

This fee is waived for applicants seeking readmission who have been previously enrolled at UIC as a graduate student, and employees of UIC.

Program-specific requirements (e.g. writing samples, personal statements, resumes, letters of purpose, letters of recommendation, etc.) must be submitted using the document upload process (see link above) unless specifically directed to you otherwise by the program to which you are applying.  (GRE, TOEFL, IELTS and other test scores must be sent directly from the testing service to UIC.

The TOEFL, IELTS, or Pearson's PTE is not required for students who have completed at least two academic years of full-time study in a country where English is the native language and in a school where English is the language of instruction within five years of the proposed date of enrollment in the University.  The TOEFL, IELTS, or Pearson's PTE may be waived for non-native English speakers who have a minimum of one year full-time employment in the U.S. or other country where the only official language of the country is English.  Applicants must submit a letter to the Admission Office from their employer verifying at least 12 consecutive months of employment and describing their English language skills.  The letter is evaluated for a decision.  Visa Certification  International students granted admission receive from the Office of Graduate and Professional Admissions all appropriate documents, including the certification forms that are required when applying for visas to enter the United States.  Financial Arrangements  International students must be able to finance themselves fully, including room and board, tuition, books, other expenses, and travel to and from the United States. Only a limited number of assistantships are available, so applicants should not plan on any financial assistance from UIC unless they receive a written offer of aid from a department.  All international applicants who plan to finance the cost of attending UIC from personal resources must certify that they will have available sufficient funds to cover their academic and living expenses for the academic year, plus living expenses for a summer. The exact amount required is set each year by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees. The amount is subject to change depending on tuition and room/board changes. The Declaration and Certification of Finances Form can be obtained from the Office of Admissions and Records or downloaded and printed. Applicants who are unable to provide satisfactory evidence of adequate finances or who have not sent a notarized certified statement verifying funds available and their source will not be granted admission. Official admission letters and visa documents cannot be sent until certification is received.  International students may apply for fellowships, assistantships, and tuition waivers. These financial aids are awarded on the basis of outstanding scholarship and potential to undertake research. Contact the director of graduate studies of the program of interest for more information.  Oral English Proficiency of Teaching Assistants  Illinois state law requires that the University attest to the English proficiency of all classroom instructors, including teaching assistants. Teaching assistants who are not native speakers of English (regardless of their citizenship status) must have their oral English proficiency assessed by the appointing department. In addition, all international students who are appointed as TAs (even if only grading) must be referred to the International Teaching Assistant Program for evaluation before they can begin their first term as a TA.  This is true even for continuing international students who may first be appointed at a TA after their first term of matriculation at UIC.   See more information from the International Teaching Assistant Program .                                 © Copyright 2016  The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois        Footer Menu   Privacy Policy  Support Graduate Education  My UIC.EDU  Contact Us  UIC           Follow Us   RSS Feed   Twitter  Facebook          Shibboleth login    Login
