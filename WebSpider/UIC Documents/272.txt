The correct spelling of my last name is "Di Eugenio", as two separate words  Research:  My main area of research is Natural Language Processing (NLP), and its application to human-computer interaction, educational technology, human-robot interaction, and multimedia systems. My goal is to use NLP to support both education and instruction, and collaboration between human or artificial agents. The theoretical aspects of my research concern the linguistic analysis, and the knowledge representation and reasoning that support the understanding and generation of NL discourse and dialogue. All my research has its empirical foundations in both qualitative and quantitative corpus analysis, including data mining techniques.  Personal:  I try to follow issues related to Human Rights. I enjoy a bit of everything, including exploring Chicago, movies, music (opera, classical, jazz), hiking, travelling, and spending time with my husband and two kids (12 and 15 years old).  The most adventurous thing I ever did ---not completely of my free will --- was to hike down inside Guagua Pichincha, an active volcano in Ecuador, and camp overnight in the crater. This was January 97. Since then, Guagua Pichincha has been gradually becoming more active, erupting more and more frequently.
