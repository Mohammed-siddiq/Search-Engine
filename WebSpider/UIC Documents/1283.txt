We do not award scholarships, and our services are available to current UIC undergraduates and professional students only.  We help students present themselves clearly and effectively for awards that best suit their needs. Our office can offer guidance on communication about academic achievement, co-curricular involvement, life experiences and financial need. Students are welcome at any point in their degree program, and are encouraged to plan ahead to prepare the strongest possible scholarship applications.  UIC undergraduate and professional school students interested in applying for nationally and internationally competitive scholarships, fellowships and external scholarship awards are encouraged to visit the Office of External Fellowships website.  UIC graduate students are encouraged to contact the Fellowships and Financial Aid Coordinator at the Graduate College.
