As a computational ecologist, she is developing techniques that can help us to better understand animal behavior and animal populations. One of her recent projects involves using images and videos uploaded to social media to develop more accurate wildlife population counts. It’s a whole new frontier.

Ethical issues covered include privacy, intellectual property, and cybercrime; communication skills taught include visual argument development, delivery techniques, and other key elements of visual and verbal communication. Extensive computer use is required. (3 semester hours.)

From the bottom up, VESE is going to build an electric Society of Automotive Engineers car. Being able to be a part of such a project—on one of the most important subsystems, torque vectoring—is invaluable.
