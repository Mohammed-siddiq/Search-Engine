Applications are considered individually by the admissions committee for graduate programs.  Successful applicants will have an existing background in computer science.   For the MS program, this means an undergraduate degree in computer science or a closely related field.  For the PhD program, this typically means a master’s degree in computer science or a related field, but exceptional applicants who seek to enter the PhD program with only an undergraduate degree may be considered for what is called “direct admission.”        Core Computer Science Courses   All our graduate courses are aimed at students with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, or an equivalent understanding. Here is a list of our core Computer Science coursework.      List of courses         Core Computer Science courses    CS 111 Program Design I  CS 141 Program Design II  CS 151 Mathematical Foundations of Computing  CS 251 Data Structures  CS 261 Machine Organization  CS 301 Languages & Automata  CS 342 Software Design  CS 361 Computer Systems  CS 385 Operating System Concepts & Design  CS 401 Computer Algorithms I   UIC Course Catalog for course descriptions.  Applicants deficient in a significant amount of core coursework should consider applying to our undergraduate program for a second bachelor’s degree or to the graduate non-degree.             Application Requirements   Applicants must meet the requirements of the Graduate College and the requirements of the computer science department. In general, applicants should be prepared with:      List of Application Requirements         List of Application Requirements    Admissions application completed online  Transcripts of all previous undergraduate and graduate work, indicating a minimum GPA of 3.5 (assuming a system in which A = 4.0) for the final 60 semester hours or 90 quarter hours of undergraduate study  GRE general test scores are recommended for all applicants and required for applicants who are applying for financial aid as well as for applicants with degrees from outside the United States. Average score requirements: minimum 308 combined verbal (153+), quantitative (155+) and analytical (4.0/6.0). No GRE subject tests are required.  English competency test . Applicants whose native language is not English are required to take an English competency test. Minimum required scores are: iBT Internet-based TOEFL of 80, with subscores of Reading 19, Listening 17, Speaking 20, and Writing 21; New Paper-Based TOEFL (after August 2018) of 60, with subscores of Reading 19, Listening 17, Writing 21; Institutional Testing Paper-Based TOEFL (prior to August 2018) of 550; IELTS of 6.5, with all four subsections of at least 6.0; or PTE-Academic of 54, with subscores of Reading 51, Listening 47, Speaking 53, and Writing 56.  Letters of recommendation (2 for MS, 3 for PhD)  Curriculum Vitae  Statement of Purpose              admissions   Direct Admission from Undergraduate to PhD  Students who wish to be considered for “direct admission” to the PhD program in computer science—those who have not yet completed a master’s degree—must fulfill the requirements outlined above and also submit a résumé and statement of purpose. Direct admission to the PhD program is highly competitive; interested students should follow the earliest possible deadlines listed on the Graduate College’s website.  Deadlines   To start in the fall semester: apply by February 1 of the year in which you plan to begin study, or by January 15 to be considered for financial aid.  To start in the spring semester: apply by July 15 of the preceding year.
