Fellowships available through the Graduate College are awarded in recognition of scholarly achievement and promise.  They enable students to pursue graduate studies and research without a service requirement.  The stipends vary by fellowships and unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fellows supported by the Graduate College (i.e., University Fellowships, Dean’s Scholar, Abraham Lincoln, DFI (formerly IMGIP/ICEOP) carry a tuition and fee waiver. (Check with your home department for details).  Some fellowships allow recipients to accept additional funding, recipients should consult the terms of the award for details.  Dean’s Scholar Award and Chancellor’s Supplemental Graduate Research Fellowship Program are the two most prestigious awards provided by the Graduate College.  These are described on the Graduate College website as follows:  Dean’s Scholar Award : The Dean’s Scholar Award is a one-year, non-renewable award presented by the Dean of the Graduate College in recognition of a student’s scholarly achievement. It is intended to provide the most distinguished, advanced-level graduate students with a period of time dedicated solely to the completion of their programs.  The Dean’s Scholar competition is open to doctoral students who have passed the Graduate College required Preliminary Examination at the University of Illinois at Chicago and are well into their dissertation work.    Application Procedures :  Deadlines for UIC fellowships and other awards administered through the Graduate College are established jointly by the Awards Committee of the Graduate College and the Graduate College.  Since departments need to submit nominations to the Graduate College (wherever it states “department nominations due”), complete application is due to the CS Student Affairs office at least 5-7 days prior to the Graduate College deadline.  Recommendation letters should be in electronic format and submitted directly by the recommender to the CS Student Affairs office ( grad@cs.uic.edu ).  Non UIC fellowships have their own submission rules. Students should contact the CS Student Affairs office for any questions upon announcement of the fellowships.  Upon announcement of the deadlines for the fellowships offered by the graduate college, students interested in applying should talk to their advisor first and with consultation must submit an Application for Graduate Appointment, statement of purpose, resume with publications and three recommendation letters (one from advisor) to the CS Student Affairs Office.  The Director of Graduate Studies will select from among the applicants and submit nominations for consideration by the Graduate College Awards Committee, which makes the final recommendation to the Dean.  Chancellor’s Supplemental Graduate Research Fellowship Program : This program supports increased multidisciplinary scholarship opportunities and exposure to careers in research and creative fields for graduate and professional students. Successful applicants must show exceptional promise for future multidisciplinary research and creative activity in their fields of interest.  Funding will allow graduate or professional candidates to supplement existing stipends with a 0% fellowship appointment for the fellowship period. Applications will be evaluated not only on the quality of the prospective student, but also the quality of the proposed project and mentored experience. A faculty mentor will direct the project but it is expected that the student will play the major role in the writing of this application.  Consult the graduate college web site for details on the program and application procedure.      Teaching Assistantships for Continuing Students  Teaching Assistantships (TA’s) are awarded to students with outstanding academic records.  TA’s assist in the teaching and grading of CS course work under the direction of the course instructor.  The assistantship includes a monthly stipend and waiver of tuition and fees.  Details of waiver are available at http://grad.uic.edu/assistantships , stipends for Computer Science students are higher than minimum specified.  Amount : Current monthly stipend is approximately $2,084 ($2,145 for students who passed the PhD qualifier) and a tuition and fee waiver. The stipend is subject to change, all fees are not covered by the waiver.    Eligibility :  Students should be on good standing as defined by the CS department to be eligible to apply.  Graduates of foreign institutions should have the Oral Certification from the ITA office.  These are the minimum requirements for TA eligibility; many factors determine the offers of TA positions.    Application Procedure :  Decisions for the following academic year (fall and spring semesters) are made during the Summer.  Students must complete and submit the online application when it is open.  Students are notified via UIC email when the application is open.  TA positions are generally assigned for the academic year (fall and spring); thus very few TA positions are available for the spring semesters.  Applications for Spring semester are available in December.

The CS Department requires ALL graduate students appointed as Graduate Teaching Assistants pass the Oral Certification administered by the International Teaching Assistant Program.  Graduate students who received their undergraduate degree in the United States or from a country in which the primary language is English are not required to receive the Certification.  Information on the ITA program can be obtained from http://grad.uic.edu/international-teaching-assistants-program-home-page / .      Tuition and Fee Waiver  A limited number of tuition and fee waivers are available to the department through Graduate College. These awards provide an exemption from tuition fee, service fee, health service fee, AFMFA, LITA and partial cost of  Campus Care health insurance (Fall & Spring only).  Students must be registered for 12 hours of study during the entire semester in which they receive the waiver.  A student who drops below the 12 hour requirement at any time in the semester will be responsible for all tuition and service fees.
