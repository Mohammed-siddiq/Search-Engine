We are quickly approaching a pivotal moment in the life of our community. The City of Chicago’s municipal election will be held on Tuesday, Feb. 26. This is an opportunity for you to let your voice be heard as you vote for the candidate(s) that best represent you. In November 2018, Chicago had its highest voter turnout for a midterm election in 32 years, with over one-quarter of all ballots being cast by voters ages 18 to 34. As Chicago’s public research university, it is our responsibility to keep the momentum going.  If you are a city resident, you may participate in early voting on campus. Early voting will take place at the following times and locations:  Student Center East, Room 613, 10 a.m.-5 p.m.  February 20, 2019  February 21, 2019  February 22, 2019  Looking to register for the upcoming election?
