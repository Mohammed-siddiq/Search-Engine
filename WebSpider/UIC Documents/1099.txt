Effective for thesis and dissertation defenses occurring on January 1, 2015 or later, students will be required to review their thesis/dissertation using iThenticate . See  http://grad.uic.edu/ithenticate-review-procedures .  Thesis Manual  The Thesis Manual was prepared by the Graduate College to provide guidance for the student and advisor in the formal preparation of the thesis, and should be consulted before the student begins compiling the document. While there are a number of format and presentation requirements that should be followed, the Graduate College allows for deviations for accepted disciplinary manuscript practices, and the guidelines allow flexiblity for many of these deviations.  Consult the manual for more information, and also consult with your advisor and department.  A checklist is provided in the back of the Thesis Manual, and it  should be carefully reviewed.  Policy on Non-English Theses and Dissertations  Theses and dissertations should be submitted in English (excluding quotes in another language).  On occasion, other languages may be used when there are sound academic reasons.  Read the Gradaute College Policy on non-English Theses and Dissertations .  The title page and abstract must always be in English.  Forms  Survey of Earned Doctorates  see also the Exams and Defense section  Thesis/Dissertation Questions  The Thesis Manual (see above) should be consulted on questions of format.  Additional questions should be directed to your advisor, Director of Graduate Studies, or program thesis coordinator since the format is mainly approved by the program.  Issues that the Thesis Manual may not fully address and that your program can't answer, as well as questions on the submission of the thesis to the Graduate College not stated in the manual, may be addressed to the Thesis Coordinator in the Graduate College.  (See Graduation and Deadlines for the term deadlines.)
