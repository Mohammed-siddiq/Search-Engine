Engineering students should visit their departmental offices to make an appointment with their advisor during the 9th week of the term (March 12 – 16).  Advising will take place during the 10th week of the term (March 19 – 23).  Failure to see your faculty advisor during this time may result in delaying your registration.

Last Names beginning with “A” – “M” should contact: Letreurna Owens at 312-996-9529 or by email at lowens2@uic.edu  Last Names beginning with “N” – “Z” should contact: Elena Diaz at 312-355-5899 or by email at ddiaz2@uic.edu my.UIC.edu my.UIC.edu is a comprehensive resource for current students which includes Registration, Financial, Academic & Personal information.  You should be using this student portal to access class schedule and registration information as well as easy login access to blackboard and other University related systems. Graduation Check Spring 2019 potential graduates, please submit a Graduation Check form that can be downloaded from the link above or picked up in our main office in room 123 SEO.  Our office staff will begin to process this request only after you have registered for your Fall 2018 courses. Submit Intent to Graduate Online! Graduation from the College of Engineering is not automatic. Students who intend to graduate following the completion of the Summer or Fall 2018 term must submit the online Intent to Graduate form no later than the 3rd week of the Fall semester.  Students may submit their Intent to Graduate through the my.UIC.edu portal. Online DARS reports Students should view their online DARS report (found in the my.UIC.edu portal) prior to attending their faculty advising appointment and print this report out to discuss with their advisor.  If you have questions about what is on your DARS report or feel that it is inaccurate, please feel free to email one of the Engineering counselors so that they can review the DARS report and make any necessary changes.  If you contact one of the counselors by email, please list your UIN and be as specific as possible about what you believe is wrong with your DARS report so that we can better understand the problem and get back to you in a timely manner. Engineering Counselors Elena Diaz – ddiaz2@uic.edu Letreurna Owens – lowens2@uic.edu Summer / Fall 2018 Schedule of Classes The online schedule of classes, listing CRNs, class times, days, and locations of course sections offered for Spring will be available for viewing starting early in the 9 th week of the term.  Please follow the link to view the Schedule of Classes for the Summer and Fall 2018 terms. Physics Placement Test As a reminder to any student who plans to take Phys 141, there is a new placement test that was put in place last Summer. The prerequisite to take Phys 141 is a grade of “C or better” or concurrent registration in Math 180 ; AND a grade of “C or better” in Phys 100 or adequate performance on the physics placement test. The physics placement test assesses your capabilities in high school algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and word problems that require quantitative reasoning. No specific background in physics is required. Information about continuing student placement test reservations can be found at :  http://testing.uic.edu/online-tests-for-continuing-students/ Time Ticket (Appointment to Register) All eligible continuing students will be able to view their time ticket on my.UIC.edu . Add / Drop / Deadlines Engineering students may DROP a class through the Friday of the second week of the Fall and Spring Semesters, through the third day of Summer Session I and through the Friday of the first week of Summer Session II without any penalty. All undergraduate students have four opportunities over the course of their UIC enrollment to drop a course without penalty from the third through tenth weeks of the Fall and Spring Semesters and from the second through fifth weeks of the Summer Session II (late drops for Summer Session I are allowed through Wednesday of week three ). Late drops in this period are approved, regardless of the circumstances, provided that the student submits a Late Drop Petition Form to the COE Front Office (123 SEO) within the designated period and that the student has not exceeded the limit of four late drops. The merits of the student’s request are not a factor in determining eligibility for an exception. Requests to drop a course after the deadlines listed above or requests to drop a course within the approved exception period in excess of the four automatic drops are not routinely granted unless there are exceptional circumstances, outside of the student’s control and that can be documented. Requests require a written petition and are reviewed by the Dean of the College. Poor performance in a course is not a sufficient reason to justify approval of a request. Because of the limitations on dropping classes, students are advised to evaluate their academic standing in the course with the instructor before requesting to exercise one of the allowable late drops. Repeating a course with Grade Point Average Recalculation ***This policy is only available to students admitted to UIC prior to Fall 2017***  All students admitted Fall 2017 and after are bound by a new Repeat Policy for Standard Graded Courses . For classes taken at UIC from the Fall 2009 forward, you can petition to have Grade Point Average Recalculation for up to 4 courses total during your UIC studies. YOU MUST DECLARE YOUR INTENT TO DO SO BY THE END OF THE 2ND WEEK OF CLASSES (1ST WEEK DURING SUMMER) .  Petition forms may be obtained from the main Engineering office in room 123 SEO.  More information on this policy can be found in the online UIC catalog under the heading Repeating a Course with Grade Point Average Recalculation. Taking a course Credit/No Credit Certain types of courses may be taken on the credit/no credit option in the College of Engineering. In this option, a student will be allowed to complete a limited number of courses with a grade of credit (CR) or no credit (NC) instead of a letter grade. Courses below the 200-level, required courses, and essential prerequisite courses cannot be taken as credit/no credit. For detailed information on the college’s policy on credit/no credit, the student should inquire in 123 SEO. Students should also check with the Department of the course they want to take Credit/No Credit to make sure that it is eligible.  Certain courses in Departments are not allowed to be taken Credit / No Credit.  Students should verify with the offering Department before submitting the form in Room 123 SEO.   Check your record for any holds that may prevent you from registering.   Students may login to my.UIC.edu to find out if there are any holds on their account that will prevent registration.  ALL Engineering students will have an Advising Hold placed on their record until they speak with their advisor. Student Responsibility As a student, you are responsible for knowing and adhering to the policies, deadline, and procedures contained in the Timetable.  Avoid potential enrollment problems by carefully reading University rules and regulations regarding registration and add/drop of courses.  You can receive credit only for those courses for which you are properly registered.  Likewise, you assume academic and financial responsibility for any course for which you register unless you officially cancel or withdraw your registration according to established deadline, which are published at the University. As a precaution, you should verify your schedule prior to the 1st day of classes, before the add/drop deadline (end of 2nd week), and prior to the late drop deadline (end of 10th week).
