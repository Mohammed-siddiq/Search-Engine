  Generalized Conditional Gradient (GCG)     Overview  GCG is an open source Matlab solver for gauge (norm)
regularized problems, that are commonly used in sparse coding and
compressive sensing.  Examples include matrix completion,
dictionary learning, and structured sparse estimation. The code includes the implementations used for all experiments in [1]. Download Latest: GCG version 2.0  Old stuff: GCG version 1.0  This version 1.0 implements the boosting algorithm in [2].
Note the loss
function for matrix completion needs to be customized in order to
efficiently compute f(U V') where U and V have a small number of
columns.  We provide a helper function here .   Disclaimer GCG is licensed under Mozilla
