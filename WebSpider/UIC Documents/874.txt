When individuals experience acts of sexual misconduct (i.e. sexual assault, stalking, dating violence, domestic violence), their sense of safety and trust is violated and this can significantly interfere with their success at the university. Our community expects that all interpersonal relationships and interactions – especially those of an intimate nature – are based upon values of mutual respect, dignity, responsibility, open communication, and clear consent.  Responding to incidents of sexual misconduct can be challenging, whether you are the person harmed or someone trying to help. We share the responsibility for creating a safer, more caring campus culture in which bias, harassment, and violence have no place—and every member of our community is free to flourish. The Prohibition of Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct policy has been developed to address all types of sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, dating violence and domestic violence.  The university takes all complaints and accusations of sexual misconduct seriously. We welcome your involvement in our mission to foster a campus environment that strives to prevent sexual misconduct and promotes the reporting of sexual misconduct, compassionate responses to survivors of sexual violence, and equitable treatment of student complainants and respondents.

The site includes information about the UIC Prohibition of Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct policy and procedures, helpful resources, and the university’s prevention and training programs.  Please look through this site to access critical information you may need such as: how to report an incident of sexual misconduct; how to get help; how to help someone who has been sexually assaulted; campus and community resources; and information about student rights and confidentiality.  The website was created by the members of the Student Response Team which include representatives from the Office of the Dean of Students, UIC Police, Office for Access and Equity, University Counsel, Campus Advocacy Network, Counseling Center, Campus Housing, Wellness Center, Office of International Services, Campus Programs, Campus Auxiliary Services, and Public Affairs.
