A record 13 new full-time faculty members joined the computer science department in the 2018-2019 school year, representing the College of Engineering’s commitment to matching an ever-expanding student population with a team of talented professors.  More than 1,200 undergraduate, master’s, and PhD students are studying computer science at UIC, up from less than 400 as recently as seven years ago. The department now has 48 full-time faculty. About 20 staff members make it possible for the department to achieve its goals, providing a range of expertise that encompasses laboratory research, computing support, student advising, and finance and administration.  In addition to performing research housed within the computer science department, our faculty members work across disciplinary lines with College of Engineering colleagues on broad-scope projects such as the Autonomous Vehicles Working Group .  Selected scholarship from the computer science faculty is on our featured research page . The department also offers a full directory of all research labs .
