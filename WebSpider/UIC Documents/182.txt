The UIC College of Engineering is recognized for its academic excellence with undergraduate and graduate programs in six academic departments: Richard and Loan Hill Department of Bioengineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil and Materials Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical and Industrial Engineering.  We are the only public research university providing engineering education in the City of Chicago, we are committed to this goal. Our slogan for the College of Engineering at UIC is to provide “Access to Excellence and Success” The College of Engineering enrolled 2955 undergraduate students, 1006 masters and 489 Ph.D. students in the Fall of 2015. The College of Engineering has 143 faculty including 31 women. Our faculty are of the highest quality. In addition, 83 of our faculty are Fellows of societies such as IEEE, ACM, ASME, AAAS, and ASCE, and 30 are National Science Foundation CAREER or Presidential Young Investigator award winners.  The research programs at the UIC College of Engineering have been growing rapidly over the years and are conducted in 6 departments and 8 interdisciplinary centers. Research expenditures totaled $21.5 million for 2015. During 2015-16, we have over 172 funded projects totaling $74 million. Our faculty are involved in interdisciplinary research in the areas of bio-technology, nano-technology, information technology and infrastructure and ENERGY/environmental technology. We understand the need for engineers and for technological advances. We promise to provide our students with an exciting education that will prepare them for emerging technologies and to be adaptable and flexible for the rapidly changing world.  Our College has developed a Strategic Plan with detailed objectives and action plans for what we want to do in the areas of faculty, students, staff, curriculum, research, corporate relations, alumni relations, student career placement, and national rankings. You will see us grow in size, increasing research activity and funding, and style of education as we expand our interdisciplinary research and integrate our corporate relations with student internships and career placement in ways not seen at other institutions.
