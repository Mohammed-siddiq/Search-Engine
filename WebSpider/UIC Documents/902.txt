You can secure your space in the incoming class by responding "yes" to the Intent to Enroll section in the my.uic.edu student portal.     When do you let me know about scholarships? Scholarships are one of several forms of assistance that may be offered to applicants as part of their financial award. Scholarships may be included in the award package, or may come independently from different sources (the Honors College, a particular college or department, an outside organization, etc.). There is not a single schedule that determines when these awards are announced. Generally, most scholarship notifications will be sent by the end of April.  See the Office of Financial Aid for more information.    When do I pick my classes? And how? Recommended courses will depend on the results of your placement tests, your major and your availability. Classes are selected in the my.uic.edu portal. Prepare for registration by reviewing the undergraduate catalog , and by viewing available courses in the schedule of classes .    Will I get credit for AP or IB classes? Advanced placement credit is awarded as a result of the scores received on the appropriate exams, not by taking the class alone. Please review our Credit by Examination page for detailed information.     I didn’t receive my admission packet in the mail. Can you help? No need to worry! All the necessary information to begin at UIC is available on this website. Additionally:  A copy of your admission letter is available in the my.uic.edu portal.      Why is the cost of attendance different than tuition and fees? Cost of attendance is a term used by federal government to capture all costs associated with attending a university. The amount is a total of both billable fees (costs that are charged by the university, like tuition and fees), and costs that a student is expected to incur like transportation, living expenses, books and others. It is used primarily for the calculation of your financial aid.      When is tuition due? Student tuition is assessed beginning in mid-August but is not officially billed to your account until after the end of the add/drop period (the second week of classes). Tuition and fees are due at the end of September for the fall semester.     I forgot to apply to the Honors College on my application, can I still apply? Yes, you can still apply to the Honors College even after you've been admitted! If you applied to UIC without indicating your interest in the Honors College, please visit the Honors College website for requirements and a link to a secondary Honors College application. View the Deadlines page for the latest Honors College priority and final deadlines.             f    my.uic.edu                           UnderGraduate      Graduate & Professional                 Office of Admissions  1200 West Harrison Street Chicago, IL 60607-7161 Phone: (312) 996-4350 Contact UIC Admissions                 Mailing Address  Undergraduate  Office of Undergraduate Admissions (MC 018) University of Illinois at Chicago 1200 West Harrison Street, Suite 1100 Chicago, IL 60607-7161 Contact Undergraduate Admissions     Graduate & Professional  The graduate and professional application process is paperless.
