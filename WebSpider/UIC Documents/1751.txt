Welcome to Your UIC Charitable Giving Resource Guide   Various units at UIC offer outlets for charitable contributions. There are opportunities to give one-time or annual monetary gifts to various organizations and causes throughout our state, community, and university.  At the UIC level… Employee contributions can support the University as a whole or be directed to a certain group or unit. Through UIC Office of Vice Chancellor for Advancement  and the UI Foundation, giving websites offer a variety of directions for employee donations. By using UIC Search tool looking for “Giving at UIC”, additional units and departmental giving opportunities can be found.   UIC Advancement - http://advancement.uic.edu/  University of Illinois Foundation: http://www.uif.uillinois.edu/    At the national, state, and community level… … all UI campuses participate in the annual Campus Charitable Fund Drive (CCFD) in partnership with the State and University Employees Combined Appeal (SECA).  UIC’s Annual Campus Charitable Fund Drive (CCFD)   Each year, UIC employees can donate to a variety of charitable organizations through the annual State and University Employee Combined Appeal (SECA). Throughout the University of Illinois system, this fund drive is known as the Campus Charitable Fund Drive (CCFD). SECA is comprised of twelve Federation Charities, representing over 1,500 charitable agencies.  The fight against global warming, aiding victims of domestic violence, supporting our troops, aiding cancer research, or alleviating hunger in your community are just a sample of the over 1,500 causes seeking assistance through SECA charitable agencies.  At UIC, our goal is to continually increase employee participation and overall pledge dollars for the annual Campus Charitable Fund Drive.  To aid in this state and university-wide campaign, each UIC department is asked to designate a CCFD Ambassador to lead department employees through this annual donation cycle. Ambassadors are sent fund drive materials to aid them.   The UIC Campus Charitable Fund Drive is coordinated by UIC Human Resources, Special Programs, in conjunction with the State of Illinois SECA charitable campaign.  What is SECA?    SECA is... ….The State and University Employees Combined Appeal  http://www.illinois.gov/seca/Pages/default.aspx   A once-a-year cooperative “on the job” campaign that allows employees to conveniently give via a one-time donation or an ongoing payroll contribution. SECA and UIC’s Campus Charitable Fund Drive combine the efforts of twelve Charity Federations with over 1,500 agencies.  All charities and agencies have submitted audited financial statements and statements of their activities, as well as signatures from at least 4,000 state employees, to obtain the approval from the Office of the Comptroller to participate in SECA/CCFD.  Annually, the State of Illinois SECA campaign raises approximately $3,000,000 for the participating SECA and member charities and over $58 million in support of charities since the annual fund drive began.     How Employees Can Donate   There are two ways for UIC employees to contribute during the annual CCFD campaign. See Pledge Form section below for the CCFD pledge form and instructions.   Continuous payroll deduction: Employees who contribute through continuous payroll deduction have a designated amount withdrawn from their check each pay period. Designations are ongoing and continue until the employee requests a change or cancellation request in writing.   At any time throughout the year a UIC employee can create, adjust, or cancel their continuous payroll deduction.  One-time donation: Employees may give a one-time donation to one or more charities of their choice by completing the One-Time Direct Gift section of the CCFD pledge form. An employee can donate as an individual or a group of employees can combine their efforts and make one larger donation.
