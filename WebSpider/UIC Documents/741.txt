For five creative seniors in the Department of Civil and Materials Engineering, it’s an opportunity.  The team of Griffin Fuller,
Alyssa Solomon, Jack Timmins, Pengcheng Wang, and Qin Wang are reimaging El
Paseo, Spanish for “The Trail,” which is an urban greenway slated for
construction in the Little Village and Pilsen neighborhoods on Chicago’s South
Side. An urban greenway is a bike and walking trail that is featured in the
city sphere while being surrounded by the natural environment, or green
vegetation and flora.  “Our inspiration came from
observing the engineering marvel of other makeshift thoroughfares such as the
Bloomingdale Trail on [Chicago’s] North Side and the High Line in New York
City,” said Fuller. “The aforementioned trails are examples of rails-to-trails,
a relatively new phenomenon that is making utility out of defunct railways to transform
them into ecological safeguards and alternative transportation routes.”  During a visit to the
Bloomingdale Trail, the students interviewed bicyclists who told them that they
had come from the South Side of Chicago to ride this linear path because a
trail doesn’t exist in their neighborhood. Armed with this information, the
team started looking for a potential area of unused land to visualize the
implementation of a similar green path in the neighborhoods that desired it. After
weeks of searching, they decided to start at the intersection of Cermak Road
and Canalport Avenue, which is a former railroad network.  “We hope to see to El Paseo
constructed in the real world,” said Fuller. “We were surprised to find out
that there is an actual bidded project underway to design and build this
greenway, so we found excitement in being able to finish our design for a small
section of the trail before the real-life project managers could.  “We hope that the final design for the trail appeals to all parties involved, most importantly, the community members and residents who inhabit the same space with El Paseo. The trail should be used safely for all travelers, interrupt traffic flow as infrequently as possible, contain and use stormwater effectively, be aesthetically appealing, prevent spikes in property costs, and be sustainable for at least the next 50 years.”  by David Staudacher         Facebook       Twitter       Google Plus       Linkedin       Tumblr       Email         0       You may also like       Engineering students take on autonomous vehicles in new multidisciplinary course       UIC Expands Its Engineering Experience Camp       UIC College of Engineering researchers selected for Discovery Partners Institute seed funding       Raymond Matthes         Previous  MIE students collaborate with Fermilab on an “out-of-this-world” project      Next  Order of the Engineer                 Connect With Us    University of Illinois at Chicago College of Engineering (M/C 159) 851 South Morgan Chicago, IL 60607    312-996-3463   Quick Links Departments  Undergraduate Admissions  Graduate Admissions  Scholarships  Alumni  Contact   Make a Gift  Resources Student Affairs  Directory  Offices  Makerspace  Career Center  Disability Resource Center   CookieSettings              University of Illinois Chicago  © Copyright 2018.
