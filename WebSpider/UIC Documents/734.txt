However, a group of students from the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering are working with Fermi National Laboratory on a project that will go much further. In fact, it’s slated to be launched into space.  Team
29, which is made up of Alexander Bulger, David Laczak, Eloise de Castelnau,
Jose Luis Salinas, and Christopher James, is working with Fermilab, a laboratory
specializing in high-energy particle physics, to develop a thermal vacuum
chamber testing station for the CubeSat (small satellite) program.  “The
team has been tasked with retrofitting a pre-existing vacuum chamber, and implementing
a heating/cooling system that is automated and can cycle through the
target temperatures of -100°C to 100°C,” Bulger explained. “Utilizing the
engineering design process of creating function means trees, metrics,
house of quality (HOQ) and methods, the project has all design
aspects considered and communicated to Fermilab, satisfying Fermilab’s criteria
and safety requirements.”  The
final design will utilize an existing cryocooler for cooling, mica heating
pads for heating, a custom shroud for even heat dispersion, and a
Raspberry Pi system for data control and collection. When all of the systems are
implemented together, they will test and validate the
future CubeSats for Fermilab’s program.  The project is an extension of the research that Castelnau performed during a summer program at Fermilab in 2018.  by David Staudacher         Facebook       Twitter       Google Plus       Linkedin       Tumblr       Email         0       You may also like       Engineering students take on autonomous vehicles in new multidisciplinary course       UIC Expands Its Engineering Experience Camp       UIC College of Engineering researchers selected for Discovery Partners Institute seed funding       Raymond Matthes         Previous  University Scholar Barbara Di Eugenio      Next  Transforming an out-of-service railway into an urban greenway                 Connect With Us    University of Illinois at Chicago College of Engineering (M/C 159) 851 South Morgan Chicago, IL 60607    312-996-3463   Quick Links Departments  Undergraduate Admissions  Graduate Admissions  Scholarships  Alumni  Contact   Make a Gift  Resources Student Affairs  Directory  Offices  Makerspace  Career Center  Disability Resource Center   CookieSettings              University of Illinois Chicago  © Copyright 2018.
