This printer works with Polyjet technology, which works by jetting tiny drops of liquid photo polymer and curing it with UV light.     Materials Available:   We currently have two different materials for the Objet 30 Prime, VeroClear (RGD-810) and VeroWhite (RGD-835) .There is also a support matrix material that is removed in post processing. There is a significant cost to switching materials on the Objet so unless a specific material is justifiably needed we keep it running VeroClear.     Parts that can be printed:   The Objet software takes STL files. It automatically handles all aspects of object placement. There is an option between a glossy finish on top-facing surfaces or a consistent matte finish. The matte finish is default â€“ ask staff for examples of glassy vs matte.  The build size on the Objet is 294 x 192 x 148.6 mm (11.57 x 7.55 x 5.85 in.) with layer heights that vary with material but are roughly 20um.     Restrictions:   Printing on the Objet is very expensive so it is only used for final prototypes and objects that require it. Staff will use their discretion when deciding what to print.
