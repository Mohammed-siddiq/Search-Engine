Approved joint degree programs share a certain number of courses that are used for both degrees. Please note that some joint degree programs do not fall under the auspices of the Graduate College. For the current list of joint degree programs currently offered at UIC, please visit the Graduate Catalog here. Applicants to the MD/PhD program should request a special application from the UIC College of Medicine (312-996-5635) or click here .  Applicants who wish to apply to more than one degree program must submit a separate application for each department involved, even if applying to an approved joint degree program. Applicants applying to more than one program should indicate on all applications submitted that they intend to pursue more than one degree at a time. Only one application fee per term and only one set of transcripts is required for applicants applying to more than one graduate program.                                 © Copyright 2016  The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois        Footer Menu   Privacy Policy  Support Graduate Education  My UIC.EDU  Contact Us  UIC           Follow Us   RSS Feed   Twitter  Facebook          Shibboleth login    Login
