The goal of the research is to develop methods and tools that enable users to manage the online data they have accumulated over many years, leveraging usercentered design and machine learning to partially automate the process. These tools will enable a better understanding of retrospective privacy in the context of modern long lived online archives. They will also empower users to more effectively manage the risks embedded in these archives.  Both Zheleva and Kanich share an interest in online data and privacy as their main areas of research. The grant, entitled “SaTC: CORE: Medium: Collaborative: Enabling Long-Term Security and Privacy through Retrospective Data Management,” runs from August 1, 2018 to July 31, 2022 and is part of an overall $1.22 million collaborative project with Professor Blasé Ur from the University of Chicago’s computer science department.
