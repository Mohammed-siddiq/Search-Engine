Those who seek to audit a course and are not presently UIC students, staff, or faculty must gain admission as graduate non-degree students. Tuition and fees will apply at the applicable level for graduate non-degree registration as an auditor.  Because the courses offered by the University of Illinois at Chicago are primarily intended for students registering for academic credit, visitors may request to audit only during the late add/drop period. The privilege of attending classes as an auditor/visitor is granted on a space-available basis on or after the first day of instruction. Auditing requires the approval of the course instructor and the dean of the college offering the course, and must be completed no later than the last day of late add/drop period. The instructor or dean may refuse to permit the auditing of a course.  Degree-seeking students considering the audit option should discuss it with their academic advisers to determine if it is the best choice, or if another grading option, such as credit/no credit, may be more appropriate.  Courses taken for audit do not apply toward any academic degree and do not count as part of a student’s full-time or part-time course load for purposes of financial aid, loan deferments, athletic eligibility, or fulfillment of the enrollment residence requirement.  Requirements/Conditions  The following requirements and conditions apply:   Not all courses may be audited. Each college/department may designate courses that do not accept auditors.  Online courses are not subject to audit. Please note that Learning Management Systems (LMS), such as Blackboard, will not be available to auditors/visitors of traditional (non online) courses that may use this type of instructional technology. Auditors should discuss the use of any LMS or Blackboard with the instructor to determine if an audit of the course is possible without access.  Visitors may not audit a course requiring the use of laboratories, studios, or computers; courses offered on an individual instruction basis; military science courses; or physical education and other activity courses. Auditors do not have the privilege of participating in class activities in any way.  In courses in which auditing is permitted, the instructor will set the attendance conditions of the audit.  When enrollment limits are a concern, registered students will be given preference over auditors.  Individual college policies may, in some cases, prohibit a student from enrolling for credit after a course has already been audited.  A student will not receive academic credit for an audited course nor be eligible to take a proficiency examination.  A student who is auditing a course but who wishes to take the course for credit must change his or her registration by the end of the late add/drop period.  There is no limit to the number of courses that may be audited. However, for currently enrolled students , audited courses may be counted toward the maximum number of semester hours allowed for the term.  Students who have been dismissed from the University for academic or disciplinary reasons or are otherwise ineligible to attend classes, are not eligible to audit classes.  An auditor is not considered a continuing student .   Procedure  Those interested in auditing must complete the following procedure:   The audit process cannot be initiated before the first day of classes.  Persons who wish to audit must obtain a Visitor’s Permit form from the Office of the Registrar during the Late Registration/Add-Drop period. They must secure the written approval of the course instructor and the dean of the college offering the course, submit the approved Visitor’s Permit to Registration and Records, and pay the required audit fee no later than the second Friday of the fall and spring semesters (first Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or first Friday of Summer Session 2).  An audited course will be indicated on a student’s academic record with a grade of AU.  Less-than-full-time degree seeking students will be assessed a $15 per course audit fee for the privilege of visiting/auditing a class. Exact change or cashier’s check made out to the University of Illinois is required for payment. Students who are assessed tuition at the full-time rate and those who are exempt from tuition do not pay the audit fee. Those who seek to audit a course and are not presently UIC students, staff, or faculty must gain admission as graduate non-degree students. Tuition and fees will apply at the applicable level for graduate non-degree registration as an auditor. Those who seek to audit a course and are not presently UIC students, staff, or faculty must gain admission as graduate non-degree students. Tuition and fees will apply at the applicable level for graduate non-degree registration as an auditor.
