CME Professor Krishna Reddy, who she is working under, accepted the award on her behalf. “Her work is quite interesting. She is working on developing an ambitious ‘zero emissions cover’ for landfills, which is a cover system that will not allow any emissions from landfills emitted into atmosphere,” said Reddy. “She’s converting…  More...           CBS News Talks to Professor Ozevin about Hazardous Bridge  March 19, 2019  Didem Ozevin, associate professor of Civil and Materials Engineering in the UIC College of Engineering, recently appeared in a CBS 2 News segment about a bridge in Joliet. CBS said the I-80 Des Plaines River Bridge in Joliet has “one of the worst structural ratings in the state.” CBS 2 sent a report and photos to Ozevin for her expert objective perspective. “There’s some permanent deformation,” she said. She also said that she’d think twice about driving over the bridges. “When I see so many members with aerial loss and deformation that makes me very concerned passing through those bridges,” Ozevin said. Throughout the last month, Ozevin has been called by the media several times to provide an expert analysis…  More...           CBS News Calls on Professor Ozevin to Review Bridge Repairs  March 6, 2019  Didem Ozevin, associate professor of Civil and Materials Engineering in the UIC College of Engineering, appeared in a CBS 2 News segment about the damaged Lake Shore Drive bridge that led to closures last month and emergency repairs in Chicago. “Right now the load is carried by those towers, so once they remove the towers, the load will transfer from the girder to the expansion joint. And they can make sure that all the stresses are below the limit. And so we can safely use that new retrofitted connection,” Ozevin said.

Professor Reddy’s ‘Green’ Research Named Best of 2018  March 4, 2019  A journal paper co-authored by CME Professor Krishna Reddy was named the best of 2018. The paper, “Field-Scale Phytoremediation of Mixed Contaminants in Upland Area of Big Marsh Site, Chicago, USA,” published in Indian Geotechnical Journal, was deemed the best paper published in the journal and awarded the IGS- AIMIL Biennial Award. The paper documents a collaboration between Reddy, his student Gema Amaya-Santos, and Chicago Park District Environmental Engineer Daniel E. Cooper, and their findings as they worked to fix a contamination problem at the Big Marsh. The Big Marsh is a park on the Chicago’s South Side in the Lake Calumet area, which is approximately 280 acres of marshland and vegetation, and almost as big as Grant Park. “The…  More...           CBS News Taps Professor Ozevin to Discuss Chicago Bridge Corrosion and Cracks  February 21, 2019  Didem Ozevin, associate professor of Civil and Materials Engineering at UIC, was featured in a CBS 2 Chicago news segment as an engineering expert to talk about the Lake Shore Drive bridge crack that led to closures on the bridge last week. Ozevin joined reporter Lauren Victory under the bridge to discuss other issues it may have. Watch the segment at https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/02/21/lake-shore-drive-bridge-corrosion-cracks/. Her research interests focus on sensor development to combine a variety of sensing elements and to develop new structural evaluation methods for understanding the damage states using variety of structural health monitoring techniques. She uses multi-physic models to understand the wave propagation phenomena on various structures to develop simple damage characterization methodologies that can be used as embedded algorithms…  More...           Professor Ozevin Talks about Chicago Bridge Crack  February 13, 2019     CME Associate Professor Didem Ozevin talked about the northbound Lake Shore Drive bridge crack for an ABC7 News segment that ran last night in Chicago. A portion of the Lake Shore Drive was closed due to cracks in the bridge's support beam. The bridge is one of nearly 3,000 in Chicago.     More...
