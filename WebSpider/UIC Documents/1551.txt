Orthopaedist and engineering doctoral candidate, Mark Gonzalez, MD, started down the road to a PhD with the Master of Engineering online program  August 8, 2013  Practicing Engineering in Orthopaedics With a father and uncle practicing engineering, it might at first seem unlikely that Mark Gonzalez would want to practice medicine. But in 1980, several years after he completed an undergraduate biochemistry degree at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, he earned his MD from the University of Chicago and started practicing orthopaedic surgery at University of Illinois Medical Center at Chicago.But Gonzalez couldn’t stay away from the family vocation forever. In 2004, he completed UIC’s Master of Engineering online program, and is currently working to finish his PhD in mechanical engineering at UIC. Gonzalez casts this progression in the light of fate. He and his father got interested in developing a set of devices to evaluate…  More...           World War II veteran, Paul Gordon, has completed the Master of Engineering online program at 85 years old  August 8, 2013  Persevering with an engineer's mindAt 85 years old, Paul Gordon (BS ’52, MS ’12) has completed UIC’s Master of Engineering online program. An accomplished structural engineer, he’s collaborated with architects including Mies van der Rohe and Harry Weese; built sections of the Calumet Skyway and nine bridges on the Northern Illinois toll road; and worked on portions of the Marina Towers, John Hancock building, and the Sears Tower. But perhaps Gordon’s greatest achievement isn’t who he’s met or what high-rise he’s built. It’s that he never quits.Flunking his entrance exams and facing anti-Semitic discrimination were only some of the setbacks Gordon faced on his return from a stint as an Army sergeant (349th Infantry Regiment, 88th Infantry Division) in Italy…  More...
